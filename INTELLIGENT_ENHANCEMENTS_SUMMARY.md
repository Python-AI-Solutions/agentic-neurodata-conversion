# Intelligent System Enhancements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the major intelligent enhancements made to the Agentic Neurodata Conversion system, transforming it from a rule-based workflow into a truly intelligent, LLM-powered assistant.

**Date**: 2025-01-17
**Enhancement Focus**: Making the system smarter, more adaptive, and more conversational using LLM capabilities

---

## üéØ Key Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The system used **fixed templates** for metadata requests that never changed, even though it analyzed each file. Users reported: *"even when i changed the input bin file it asked for same information"*

**Solution**: Implemented **dynamic, file-specific metadata requests** that adapt to each file based on what was learned from analysis.

---

## üöÄ Major Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Metadata Request Generation

**File**: `backend/src/agents/conversation_agent.py`
**Function**: `_generate_dynamic_metadata_request()` (lines 59-192)

**What Changed**:
- ‚ùå **Before**: Fixed template asking same 3 questions for every file
- ‚úÖ **After**: LLM generates custom questions based on file analysis

**How It Works**:
```python
# OLD (Fixed Template):
message = """
üî¥ Critical Information Needed
‚Ä¢ Experimenter Name(s)
‚Ä¢ Experiment Description
‚Ä¢ Institution
"""

# NEW (Dynamic Generation):
message = await self._generate_dynamic_metadata_request(
    missing_fields=missing_fields,
    inference_result=state.metadata.get("_inference_result", {}),
    file_info={
        "name": filename,
        "format": detected_format,
        "size_mb": file_size,
    },
    state=state,
)
```

**Example Output** (for SpikeGLX file):
```
üîç I've analyzed your SpikeGLX recording (Noise4Sam_g0_t0.imec0.ap.bin):

‚úÖ What I found:
‚Ä¢ Neuropixels probe recording at 30kHz
‚Ä¢ Action potential (AP) data stream
‚Ä¢ Possible mouse recording (based on filename)

To create a DANDI-compatible file, I need a few more details:
‚Ä¢ Experimenter: Who conducted this recording?
‚Ä¢ Institution: Where was this recorded?
‚Ä¢ Experiment Description: What was the purpose?
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Each file gets personalized questions
- ‚úÖ Users see the system actually analyzed their file
- ‚úÖ Questions reference file-specific context
- ‚úÖ Feels like talking to an AI assistant, not filling a form

---

### 2. Enhanced Metadata Inference Engine

**File**: `backend/src/agents/metadata_inference.py`
**Functions**: Enhanced prompts in `_llm_powered_inference()` (lines 265-371)

**What Changed**:
- ‚ùå **Before**: Basic inference with simple prompts
- ‚úÖ **After**: Rich, detailed inference with domain expertise

**Enhanced System Prompt**:
```python
system_prompt = """You are an expert neuroscience data curator with deep knowledge of:
- Electrophysiology recording systems (SpikeGLX/Neuropixels, Open Ephys, Intan)
- Common neuroscience experimental paradigms and protocols
- NWB metadata requirements and DANDI archive standards
- Brain anatomy and common recording targets
- Model organisms used in neuroscience research

Your job is to make intelligent, context-aware inferences...
"""
```

**What It Now Infers**:
- Recording modality (electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, optogenetics)
- Species + strain (e.g., "C57BL/6J mouse")
- Brain regions with full anatomical names
- Experimental context (task, stimulation, recording conditions)
- Recording system details
- Suggested keywords (5-7 contextual keywords)
- Institution/lab hints from filename patterns

**Example Inference**:
```json
{
  "inferred_metadata": {
    "recording_modality": "extracellular electrophysiology",
    "species": "Mus musculus",
    "species_strain": "C57BL/6J (inferred from typical lab use)",
    "brain_region": "V1",
    "brain_region_full": "primary visual cortex (V1)",
    "experiment_description": "Extracellular electrophysiology recording from mouse primary visual cortex using Neuropixels probes",
    "recording_system": "SpikeGLX with Neuropixels",
    "keywords": ["electrophysiology", "neuropixels", "mouse", "V1", "visual cortex", "extracellular recording"]

    "recording_modality": 95,
    "species": 85,
    "brain_region": 80,
    "experiment_description": 85
  }
}
```

       "species": "Mus musculus",
       "keywords": ["electrophysiology", "mouse", "V1", "visual cortex"]
   }
   ```

3. **Handles Complex Responses**:
   ```python
   User: "Recorded by Dr. Sarah Johnson at UC Berkeley. We used neuropixels
          to record from awake mouse hippocampus during spatial navigation task"

   Extracted:
   {
       "experimenter": ["Dr. Sarah Johnson"],
       "institution": "University of California, Berkeley",
       "experiment_description": "Extracellular electrophysiology recording from mouse
                                 hippocampus using Neuropixels probes during spatial
                                 navigation behavior",

                    "spatial navigation", "behavior", "awake recording"]
   }
   ```

4. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Rates extraction confidence 0-100
   - Asks follow-up questions if confidence < 70

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Users can provide info naturally ("Smith lab, mouse V1")
- ‚úÖ System infers and expands abbreviated information
- ‚úÖ Automatically adds contextual keywords
- ‚úÖ Handles both minimal and detailed responses
