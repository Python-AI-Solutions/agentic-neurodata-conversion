# Agentic Neurodata Conversion - Validation & QA Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Architecture First
All validation components must follow clear separation of concerns with granular modularity. Each module (Core Framework, NWB Inspector, LinkML, Quality Assessment, Domain Validator, Orchestrator, Reporting, MCP Integration) must be:
- Self-contained with defined interfaces
- Independently testable and deployable
- Well-documented with clear purpose
- No cross-module dependencies except through defined contracts

### II. Standards Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- All validation must conform to NWB community standards and best practices
- FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are mandatory
- Schema validation against current NWB versions is required
- LinkML schemas must be machine-readable and version-controlled

### III. Quality-First Development
- Test-Driven Development for all validation logic
- Multi-dimensional quality metrics: completeness, consistency, accuracy, compliance
- Scientific plausibility checks required for all neuroscience data
- Remediation guidance must accompany every validation issue

### IV. Traceability & Observability
- Structured logging with configurable levels across all modules
- Validation context tracking for debugging and audit trails
- Detailed error reporting with stack traces and location information
- Analytics and trend tracking for continuous quality improvement

### V. Configuration & Flexibility
- Profile-based configuration management (dev, test, prod)
- Runtime configuration updates without service restart
- Configurable validation thresholds and filters
- Support for custom quality metrics and domain rules

## Technical Standards

### Data Quality Requirements
- Completeness analysis against schemas and standards
- Consistency validation across related fields and structures
- Accuracy verification through domain knowledge rules
- Compliance checking with weighted scoring algorithms

### Validation Pipeline
- Support for parallel and sequential validation workflows
- Dependency management between validators
- Results aggregation with conflict resolution
- Progress tracking and status reporting

### Integration Architecture
- MCP-compliant tools interface for all validation functions
- Standardized input/output formats (JSON, structured data)
- Asynchronous operation support for long-running validations
- Service discovery and health check endpoints

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Requirements
1. All validators extend `BaseValidator` abstract class
2. All results use `ValidationResult` and `ValidationIssue` dataclasses
3. Exception handling with detailed error context is mandatory
4. Error recovery mechanisms for non-critical failures

### Testing Gates
- Unit tests for individual validators
- Integration tests for validator orchestration
- Domain-specific test cases for neuroscience rules
- Performance benchmarks for large NWB files

### Documentation Standards
- User stories and acceptance criteria for all requirements
- API documentation for all public interfaces
- Remediation guidance for validation issues
- Examples and best practices for common scenarios

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All implementations must:
- Verify compliance with modular architecture principles
- Include validation against NWB and LinkML schemas
- Provide structured, actionable error messages
- Support both automated and interactive workflows

Amendments require:
- Documentation of rationale and impact
- Approval from project maintainers
- Migration plan for existing implementations
- Update to relevant specifications and tests
