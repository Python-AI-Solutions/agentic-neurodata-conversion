## Recommendation

**For New Team Members**: Start with v1.0.0 to understand the core philosophy, then read v3.0.0 hierarchical format for current requirements.

**For Compliance Reviews**: Use v3.0.0 hierarchical format with requirement IDs (REQ-XXX-NNN).

**For Deep Understanding**: Read v3.0.0 detailed format for complete rationale and context.

**For Historical Context**: Compare v1.0.0 with v3.0.0 to see how principles evolved from 6 simple principles to 8 comprehensive principles with 100+ explicit requirements.
