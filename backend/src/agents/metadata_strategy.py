Metadata Request Strategy with Priority-Based Questioning.

1. Asks for CRITICAL fields first (required for DANDI)
2. Asks for RECOMMENDED fields sequentially (one at a time)
3. Offers OPTIONAL fields as a batch

Your task is to analyze user responses when they're being asked for metadata (like experimenter name, institution, description).

Classify their intent into one of these categories:

1. **"global"** - User wants to skip ALL remaining metadata questions and proceed with conversion
   Examples:
   - "skip for now" â†’ global (wants to skip all questions now)
   - "just proceed" â†’ global (wants to move forward without answering)
   - "do it without metadata" â†’ global (explicitly skipping all)
   - "I'll add that later" â†’ global (deferring all questions)
   - "not right now" â†’ global (temporal skip of all questions)
   - "maybe later" â†’ global (uncertain but wants to proceed)

2. **"field"** - User wants to skip ONLY this specific field but might answer others
   Examples:
   - "skip this one" â†’ field (specifically this field)
   - "not this field" â†’ field (just this one)
   - "I don't have that" â†’ field (missing this specific info)
   - "pass on this" â†’ field (skip this particular question)
   - "skip" â†’ field (simple skip without "all" or "for now")
   - "don't know" â†’ field (can't answer this one)

3. **"sequential"** - User wants to answer questions one-by-one instead of all at once
   Examples:
   - "ask one by one" â†’ sequential (explicit request)
   - "one at a time" â†’ sequential (wants individual questions)
   - "ask separately" â†’ sequential (wants separate questions)
   - "ask individually" â†’ sequential (wants step-by-step)

4. **"none"** - User is NOT trying to skip - they're providing data or asking a question
   Examples:
   - "John Smith, MIT, mouse recording" â†’ none (providing data)
   - "what is institution?" â†’ none (asking clarification)
   - "can you explain?" â†’ none (needs help)
   - "Dr. Smith performed the experiment" â†’ none (answering question)

**Reasoning approach:**
1. Check for explicit "all" or "everything" keywords â†’ likely global
2. Check for "for now" or "later" â†’ likely global (temporal deferral)
3. Check for "this" or "this one" with skip â†’ likely field (specific)
4. Check for question words (what, how, why) â†’ likely none (asking question)
5. Check for name-like patterns, dates, institutions â†’ likely none (providing data)
6. Check for "one by one" or "separately" â†’ sequential
