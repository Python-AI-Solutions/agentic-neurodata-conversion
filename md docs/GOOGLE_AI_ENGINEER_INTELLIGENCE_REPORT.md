## Executive Summary

After comprehensive review of this three-agent agentic NWB conversion system, I've identified **high-impact opportunities** to enhance intelligence using LLMs while addressing **critical logical bugs** and **architectural risks**. The system has excellent foundation (Phase 1-4 complete, intelligent modules present, 96% flag reduction achieved), but several gaps prevent it from being a truly production-grade AI system.

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Strong centralized state management (WorkflowStateManager)
- Multiple intelligent modules (MetadataInferenceEngine, SmartAutoCorrectionSystem, AdaptiveRetryStrategy, etc.)
- Comprehensive requirements.md with detailed user stories
- Recent workflow fixes (enum-based type safety, frontend-backend integration)

**Critical Issues Found:**
- üî¥ **3 high-severity bugs** in state management and metadata flow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **5 logical edge cases** not handled
- üéØ **7 LLM enhancement opportunities** (high ROI)
- üîß **4 architectural improvements** needed for scale

**Recommended Priority:**
1. Fix 3 critical bugs (blocking production use)
2. Implement 3 highest-ROI LLM enhancements
3. Address 5 edge cases
4. Consider 4 architectural improvements for v2

## 1. Critical Bugs & Logical Issues

### üî¥ BUG #1: Race Condition in Conversation History Management

**File:** [backend/src/models/state.py](backend/src/models/state.py)
**Severity:** HIGH (Data integrity risk)

**Problem:**
```python
# Line ~350 in GlobalState
self.conversation_history.append(message)  # No locking
```

`conversation_history` is a list accessed by multiple agents (Conversation Agent, Conversational Handler) without synchronization. With FastAPI's async model, concurrent access during metadata collection ‚Üí LLM processing ‚Üí response generation can cause:
- Message ordering corruption
- Duplicate messages
- Lost conversation context

**Impact:**
- LLM gets malformed conversation history
- User sees out-of-order messages in frontend
- Metadata extraction fails due to missing context

**Evidence:**
Looking at [conversation_agent.py:136](backend/src/agents/conversation_agent.py#L136):
```python
recent_user_messages = [msg for msg in state.conversation_history if msg.get('role') == 'user']
```

If another async task appends during iteration, this can raise `RuntimeError` or return incomplete data.

**Fix:**
```python
# In GlobalState class
import asyncio
from typing import List

class GlobalState(BaseModel):
    conversation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(default_factory=list)
    _conversation_lock: asyncio.Lock = PrivateAttr(default_factory=asyncio.Lock)

    async def add_conversation_message(self, message: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Thread-safe conversation message append."""
        async with self._conversation_lock:
            self.conversation_history.append(message)

    async def get_conversation_history_snapshot(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get immutable snapshot of conversation history."""
        async with self._conversation_lock:
            return list(self.conversation_history)  # Copy
```

**Why This Works:**
- `asyncio.Lock` prevents concurrent modifications
- Snapshot pattern returns copy, safe to iterate
- All agents must use `add_conversation_message()` instead of direct append

**Related Code Locations:**
- [backend/src/agents/conversation_agent.py:136-138](backend/src/agents/conversation_agent.py#L136)
- [backend/src/agents/conversational_handler.py:~80](backend/src/agents/conversational_handler.py)
- [backend/src/api/main.py:~450](backend/src/api/main.py) (chat endpoint)

### üî¥ BUG #2: Metadata Policy Not Reset on New Upload

**File:** [backend/src/models/workflow_state_manager.py:](backend/src/models/workflow_state_manager.py)
 & [backend/src/models/state.py](backend/src/models/state.py)
**Severity:** HIGH (Workflow logic error)

**Problem:**
When user uploads a NEW file after completing a conversion, `metadata_policy` persists from previous session:

```python
# In reset() method - state.py
def reset(self) -> None:
    """Reset state to initial values."""
    self.status = ConversionStatus.IDLE
    self.input_path = None
    self.output_path = None
    self.metadata = {}
    self.conversation_history = []
    self.conversion_messages = []
    self.validation_result = None
    self.correction_attempt = 0
    # ... BUT NO metadata_policy reset!
```

**Impact:**
If user's first session has `metadata_policy = MetadataRequestPolicy.USER_DECLINED`, when they upload a second file, the system skips metadata collection entirely:

```python
# WorkflowStateManager.should_request_metadata() - Line 60
def should_request_metadata(self, state: GlobalState) -> bool:
    return (
        self._has_missing_required_fields(state) and
        self._not_already_asked(state) and
        not self._user_declined_metadata(state) and  # ‚ùå Still set from previous session!
        not self._in_active_metadata_conversation(state)
    )
```

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Upload file #1
2. When asked for metadata, user types "skip all"
3. Conversion completes
4. User uploads file #2 (different dataset)
5. **BUG**: System never requests metadata for file #2 (incorrectly assumes user declined)

**Fix:**
```python
# In GlobalState.reset() method
def reset(self) -> None:
    """Reset state to initial values for new conversion."""
    self.status = ConversionStatus.IDLE
    self.input_path = None
    self.output_path = None
    self.metadata = {}
    self.conversation_history = []
    self.conversion_messages = []
    self.validation_result = None
    self.correction_attempt = 0
    self.metadata_requests_count = 0  # Already reset
    self.metadata_policy = MetadataRequestPolicy.NOT_REQUESTED  # ADD THIS!
    self.conversation_phase = ConversationPhase.IDLE  # ADD THIS!
    self.conversation_type = "idle"  # ADD THIS!
    # ... rest of reset
```

**Test Case Needed:**
```python
async def test_metadata_policy_reset_between_sessions():
    """Ensure metadata policy doesn't persist across uploads."""
    state = GlobalState(status=ConversionStatus.IDLE)
    manager = WorkflowStateManager()

    # Session 1: User declines
    state.metadata_policy = MetadataRequestPolicy.USER_DECLINED
    state.reset()

    # Session 2: New upload
    assert state.metadata_policy == MetadataRequestPolicy.NOT_REQUESTED
    assert manager.should_request_metadata(state) == True  # Should ask again!
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BUG #3: MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS Not Enforced in All Paths

**File:** [backend/src/models/state.py](backend/src/models/state.py)
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Can cause infinite loops)

**Problem:**
The `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 5` constant exists, but retry limit is only checked via `can_retry` field. However, `can_retry` is computed in `set_validation_result()` but NOT re-checked before actually starting a retry.

Looking at the workflow:
```python
# State has can_retry = True (attempt 4 of 5)
# User approves retry
# Somewhere between approval and retry execution, correction_attempt gets incremented
# BUT if set_validation_result() isn't called again, can_retry stays True
# System attempts retry #6, #7, ... indefinitely
```

**Current Code:**
```python
# state.py - set_validation_result()
def set_validation_result(...):
    # ...
    self.can_retry = self.correction_attempt < self.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS  # Set once
    # ...
```

**Issue:**
`can_retry` is a cached value. If `correction_attempt` increments elsewhere (e.g., in retry approval handler), `can_retry` doesn't auto-update.

**Fix Approach 1 (Property):**
```python
# Make can_retry a computed property instead of a field
class GlobalState(BaseModel):
    correction_attempt: int = Field(default=0, ge=0, le=5)  # Add max validation
    MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: int = 5

    @property
    def can_retry(self) -> bool:
        """Compute can_retry dynamically - always accurate."""
        return self.correction_attempt < self.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS

    # Remove can_retry from Field definitions
```

**Fix Approach 2 (Validate Before Retry):**
```python
# In WorkflowStateManager or wherever retry is triggered
def can_approve_retry(self, state: GlobalState) -> bool:
    """Guard: Check if retry is actually allowed."""
    if state.correction_attempt >= state.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS:
        return False
    if state.status != ConversionStatus.AWAITING_RETRY_APPROVAL:
        return False
    return True
```

**Why This Matters:**
Adaptive Retry Strategy (adaptive_retry.py) has logic to stop at 5 attempts, but if state management fails, system could loop forever consuming API credits.

## 2. LLM Intelligence Enhancement Opportunities

### üéØ Enhancement #1: Predictive Metadata Completion with Confidence Scoring

**Opportunity:** Use LLM to predict ALL missing DANDI fields from file analysis + partial user input

**Current State:**
MetadataInferenceEngine exists ([metadata_inference.py](backend/src/agents/metadata_inference.py)) but only infers a few fields (species, brain region). Doesn't leverage full LLM reasoning power.

**Intelligence Gap:**
When user provides: "Dr. Jane Smith from MIT, male mouse, visual cortex experiment"

Current system extracts:
- experimenter: "Dr. Jane Smith"
- institution: "MIT"
- species: "Mus musculus" (inferred)
- sex: "M"

**Missed Opportunities:**
- Could infer `lab = "Smith Lab"` (common pattern)
- Could infer `experiment_description = "Visual cortex electrophysiology"` from context
- Could suggest `session_start_time` from file metadata timestamps
- Could infer `subject_id = "mouse_001"` if follows common naming

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python
# In MetadataInferenceEngine
async def _llm_powered_inference(
    self,
    file_meta: Dict,
    heuristic_inferences: Dict,
    state: GlobalState,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Use LLM for comprehensive metadata prediction."""

    system_prompt = """You are an expert neuroscience metadata analyst.

Given file information and partial user input, predict ALL missing DANDI metadata fields.
For each prediction, provide:
1. Predicted value
2. Confidence score (0-100)
3. Reasoning (why this prediction makes sense)

Be conservative: Only predict if confidence >= 70. Better to ask user than guess wrong."""

    user_prompt = f"""Predict missing metadata from this context:

**File Analysis:**
{json.dumps(file_meta, indent=2)}

**User Provided So Far:**
{json.dumps(state.metadata, indent=2)}

**Heuristic Inferences:**
{json.dumps(heuristic_inferences, indent=2)}

**Required DANDI Fields:**
{', '.join(WorkflowStateManager.REQUIRED_DANDI_FIELDS)}

For each MISSING required field, predict:
- Most likely value based on context
- Confidence (0-100)
- Reasoning

{{
  "predictions": {{
    "field_name": {{
      "value": "predicted value",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "Explanation of inference"
    }}
  }},
  "low_confidence_fields": ["field1", "field2"],  // Need to ask user
  "suggestions_for_user": "Friendly message explaining what we inferred and what we need"
}}"""

    output_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "predictions": {
                "type": "object",

                    "properties": {
                        "value": {"type": ["string", "number", "null"]},
                        "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100},
                        "reasoning": {"type": "string"}
                    },
                    "required": ["value", "confidence", "reasoning"]
                }
            },
            "low_confidence_fields": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "suggestions_for_user": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["predictions", "low_confidence_fields", "suggestions_for_user"]
    }

    result = await self.llm_service.complete_structured(
        system=system_prompt,
        user=user_prompt,
        output_schema=output_schema,
        temperature=0.3,  # Conservative predictions
    )

    # Filter: Only use predictions with confidence >= 70
    high_confidence = {
        field: pred
        for field, pred in result["predictions"].items()
        if pred["confidence"] >= 70
    }

    return {
        "inferred_metadata": {f: p["value"] for f, p in high_confidence.items()},
        "confidence_scores": {f: p["confidence"] for f, p in high_confidence.items()},
        "reasoning": {f: p["reasoning"] for f, p in high_confidence.items()},
        "need_user_input": result["low_confidence_fields"],
        "suggestion_message": result["suggestions_for_user"],
    }
```

**Impact:**
- Reduce user burden (fewer fields to manually enter)
- Improve data quality (LLM catches patterns humans miss)
- Faster workflow (auto-fill + verify vs. ask for everything)

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "predictions": {
    "lab": {
      "value": "Smith Lab",
      "confidence": 92,
      "reasoning": "Experimenter is 'Dr. Jane Smith' at MIT - standard convention is to name lab after PI"
    },
    "experiment_description": {
      "value": "Visual cortex electrophysiology using Neuropixels probes",
      "confidence": 88,
      "reasoning": "File format is SpikeGLX (Neuropixels), user mentioned 'visual cortex', multi-channel recording detected"
    },
    "subject_id": {
      "value": null,
      "confidence": 45,
      "reasoning": "Too low to auto-fill - need explicit user input for unique identifier"
    }
  },
  "need_user_input": ["subject_id", "session_start_time"],
  "suggestions_for_user": "I've automatically filled in your lab name and experiment description based on your file and the experimenter you mentioned. I just need two more details: a unique subject ID for this animal, and when the recording session started."
}
```

**ROI:** HIGH - Directly improves user experience, minimal code changes

### üéØ Enhancement #2: Validation Issue Root Cause Analysis

**Opportunity:** Use LLM to explain WHY validation failed in domain-specific language

**Current State:**
NWB Inspector returns cryptic messages like:
```
"check_name": "subject_age_check"
"message": "Subject age is missing"
```

**Intelligence Gap:**
User sees error but doesn't understand:
- Why does DANDI archive require age?
- What format should age be in?
- Can they proceed without it?
- What happens to their data if they skip it?

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python
# In IntelligentValidationAnalyzer (already exists!)
async def explain_validation_issue(
    self,
    issue: ValidationIssue,
    file_context: Dict,
    state: GlobalState,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate domain-expert explanation of validation issue."""

    system_prompt = """You are a helpful NWB and DANDI expert.

Explain validation issues in plain language that neuroscientists understand.
Focus on:
1. WHAT the issue is (simple terms)
2. WHY it matters for science (discoverability, reproducibility)
3. HOW to fix it (concrete steps)
4. IMPACT if skipped (what limitations user will face)

Be encouraging and constructive, not judgmental."""

    user_prompt = f"""Explain this validation issue:

**Issue:**
- Check: {issue.check_name}
- Severity: {issue.severity}
- Message: {issue.message}
- Location: {issue.location}

**File Context:**
- Format: {file_context.get('format')}
- Size: {file_context.get('size_mb')} MB
- Recording Type: {file_context.get('recording_type', 'unknown')}

**User's Goal:**
- {state.experiment_description or "General neuroscience data sharing"}

Generate a friendly, helpful explanation that:
1. Explains what '{issue.check_name}' means in neuroscience terms
2. Why DANDI/NWB requires this
3. Concrete fix suggestion with example
4. What happens if user chooses to skip this field

Keep it 2-3 paragraphs, conversational tone."""

    output_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "plain_language_explanation": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "2-3 paragraph friendly explanation"

            },
            "example_good_value": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Example of correct value (if applicable)"
            },
            "can_auto_fix": {
                "type": "boolean",
                "description": "Whether system can fix this automatically"
            },
            "auto_fix_strategy": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "If auto-fixable, how"
            }
        },
        "required": ["plain_language_explanation", "quick_fix_suggestion", "impact_if_skipped", "can_auto_fix"]
    }

    result = await self.llm_service.complete_structured(
        system=system_prompt,
        user=user_prompt,
        output_schema=output_schema,
        temperature=0.5,
    )

    return result
```

**Example Output:**
Instead of:
> "Subject age is missing"

User sees:
> **What's Missing:** Subject age tells other researchers how old your animal was during the experiment.
>
> **Why It Matters:** Age is critical for reproducibility - neural development stages affect data interpretation. Without it, other researchers can't properly compare your results to theirs. DANDI requires age for discoverability in their archive search.
>
> **How to Fix:** Provide age in ISO 8601 duration format. For example, a 60-day-old mouse would be `P60D` (P = period, 60 = number, D = days). For a 3-month-old rat, use `P3M`.
>
> **If You Skip:** Your file will still be valid NWB, but DANDI archive may reject it during submission. Other researchers won't find your data when searching by age range.
>
> **Quick Fix:** Enter something like `P90D` for a 90-day-old animal.

**Impact:**
- Reduces user confusion
- Educational (users learn NWB/DANDI standards)
- Increases data quality (users understand WHY fields matter)
- Reduces abandonment rate

**ROI:** HIGH - Better UX with minimal latency cost (LLM call during idle waiting time)

### üéØ Enhancement #3: Intelligent Retry Strategy with Learning

**Opportunity:** Make AdaptiveRetryStrategy truly adaptive using historical failure patterns

**Current State:**
AdaptiveRetryStrategy ([adaptive_retry.py](backend/src/agents/adaptive_retry.py)) has good foundation but doesn't actually LEARN from past failures across multiple sessions.

**Intelligence Gap:**
If 100 users all fail validation with the same issue (e.g., "missing experimenter field"), current system:
- Treats each failure independently
- No cross-session learning
- Repeats same unsuccessful fix attempts

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python
# Create new module: agents/retry_pattern_learner.py

```

**Integration with AdaptiveRetryStrategy:**
```python
# In adaptive_retry.py
async def analyze_and_recommend_strategy(self, state, current_validation_result):
    # ... existing code ...

    # NEW: Check historical patterns
    issue_type = self._classify_failure_type(current_validation_result)
    historical_insight = await self.pattern_learner.analyze_historical_patterns(issue_type)

    if historical_insight["has_patterns"] and historical_insight["confidence"] >= 70:
        return {
            "should_retry": True,
            "strategy": historical_insight["recommended_strategy"],
            "approach": "learned_from_history",
            "message": f"Based on {historical_insight['historical_data']['total_attempts']} similar cases, I'll try {historical_insight['recommended_strategy']}. {historical_insight['reasoning']}",

        }

    # Fallback to heuristic if no patterns
    return self._heuristic_strategy(state, current_validation_result)
```

**Impact:**
- System gets smarter over time
- Reduces avg. retry attempts (uses strategies that work)
- Identifies systematic issues (e.g., "99% of SpikeGLX files fail because users forget experimenter")

**ROI:** MEDIUM - Requires persistence layer, but high long-term value

### üéØ Enhancement #4: Conversational Metadata Collection with Context Awareness

**Opportunity:** Make metadata requests feel like natural conversation, not form-filling

**Current State:**
[conversation_agent.py:_generate_dynamic_metadata_request()](backend/src/agents/conversation_agent.py#L78) already has some dynamic generation, but could be more conversational.

**Intelligence Gap:**
Current approach:
> "I need experimenter, institution, experiment_description, session_start_time, subject_id, species, sex."

Better approach (Claude.ai style):
> "I've analyzed your SpikeGLX recording - looks like a high-density Neuropixels probe recording! I can see it's 47 channels over 10 minutes. To make this DANDI-ready, I have a few quick questions. First, who was the lead experimenter on this recording?"

Then after user responds "Dr. Jane Smith":
> "Great! Dr. Jane Smith. And which institution or lab was this recorded at?"

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python
# In conversation_agent.py or new conversational_metadata_collector.py

```

**Example Conversation Flow:**
```
ü§ñ: I've analyzed your recording - it's a 47-channel Neuropixels probe, 10 minutes of data at 30kHz. Impressive! To prep this for DANDI, let's start with the basics. Who was the lead experimenter on this recording?

üë§: Jane Smith

ü§ñ: Thanks! And which institution or lab is Dr. Smith affiliated with?

üë§: MIT

ü§ñ: Perfect. For the DANDI archive search, we need a unique subject ID - something like "mouse_001" or "subj_001". What ID did you use for this animal?

üë§: mouse_vcp_01

ü§ñ: Got it - mouse_vcp_01. One last question: what was the main goal of this experiment? (E.g., "visual cortex responses to oriented gratings")

üë§: Studying V1 responses during active behavior

ü§ñ: Excellent! I have everything I need. Converting now...
```

**Impact:**
- Feels like chatting with a colleague, not filling a form
- Reduces cognitive load (one question at a time)
- Educational (explains WHY each field matters)
- Higher completion rate (less overwhelming)

**ROI:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Requires LLM calls per question, but dramatically better UX

### üéØ Enhancement #5: Validation Report Insights with LLM Analysis

**Opportunity:** Generate executive summary of validation results in neuroscientist language

**Current State:**
Evaluation Agent generates reports ([evaluation_agent.py](backend/src/agents/evaluation_agent.py)) but they're largely template-based with NWB Inspector raw output.

**Intelligence Gap:**
User sees:
```
Validation Issues:
- subject_age_check: FAILED
- electrode_group_missing: WARNING
- session_description_check: WARNING
```

What user wants to know:
- Is my data usable for my specific use case?
- Will DANDI accept this?
- What should I prioritize fixing?
- How does this compare to typical submissions?

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python
# In evaluation_agent.py or new report_analyzer.py

**Example Output:**
```
üìä VALIDATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overall Assessment:
Your NWB file is scientifically valid and ready for most research uses. The core electrophysiology data, electrode configurations, and timestamps are all properly formatted. However, there are 3 metadata gaps that will prevent DANDI archive submission.

DANDI Readiness:
‚ùå NOT ready for DANDI (missing required metadata)

Must Fix:
‚Ä¢ Add subject age - Required by DANDI for all animal experiments. Use ISO format like "P90D" for a 90-day-old animal.
‚Ä¢ Add experimenter name - DANDI requires this for data attribution and searchability.
‚Ä¢ Specify session start time - Needed for temporal data alignment and reproducibility.

Nice to Fix:
‚Ä¢ Add electrode impedance values - Helps other researchers assess data quality, but not blocking
‚Ä¢ Include behavioral task description - Enhances discoverability, but your file is usable without it

Impact on Science:
For your stated goal of "studying V1 responses during active behavior," this file has everything needed - your spike times, LFP, and electrode locations are all high-quality. The missing metadata doesn't affect your ability to analyze or share this data with collaborators. It ONLY blocks formal DANDI archive submission.

Next Steps:
1. Click "Improve File" to automatically add the 3 required fields
2. The system will prompt you for experimenter name, age, and session time
3. Re-validation will take ~30 seconds
4. Once fixed, you'll get a DANDI-ready file + quality report

Comparison:
Your file is above average! ~60% of first submissions to DANDI have similar metadata gaps. The electrophysiology data quality looks excellent (proper sampling rates, clean timestamps, correct electrode mapping).
```

**Impact:**
- Users understand results in domain language
- Clear prioritization (what actually matters)
- Encourages fixing issues (shows it's easy)
- Educational (learn DANDI standards)

**ROI:** HIGH - One LLM call per validation, huge UX improvement

### üéØ Enhancement #6: Smart Issue Clustering & Batch Fixes

**Opportunity:** Group related validation issues and fix them together intelligently

**Current State:**
SmartIssueResolution exists ([smart_issue_resolution.py](backend/src/agents/smart_issue_resolution.py)) but treats each issue independently.

**Intelligence Gap:**
When NWB Inspector returns 15 warnings like:
- Missing electrode impedance for electrode_0
- Missing electrode impedance for electrode_1
- ...
- Missing electrode impedance for electrode_14

Current system:
- Lists all 15 issues
- User overwhelmed
- No indication these are ONE root cause

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```python

**Example Output:**
Instead of:
> 15 validation warnings found

User sees:
> **3 Issue Groups Found:**
>
> 1. **Electrode Metadata Missing** (15 related issues)
>    - All 15 electrodes are missing impedance values
>    - Fix: I can set default impedance of 1 MŒ© (standard for Neuropixels), or you can provide actual values
>    - ‚úÖ Auto-fixable in ~5 seconds
>
> 2. **Subject Information Incomplete** (2 related issues)
>    - Missing age and weight
>    - Fix: Need you to provide subject age (e.g., "P90D")
>    - ‚ùå Requires your input (30 seconds)
>
> 3. **Session Metadata** (1 issue)
>    - Session description is generic
>    - Fix: I can generate a description from your file analysis, or you can provide custom text
>    - ‚úÖ Auto-fixable in ~2 seconds

**Impact:**
- Reduces perceived issue count (15 ‚Üí 3 groups)
- Clearer fixing strategy
- Batch fixes more efficient
- Less user fatigue

**ROI:** MEDIUM - Requires smart clustering logic, good UX improvement

### üéØ Enhancement #7: Proactive File Quality Check on Upload

**Opportunity:** Check file for common issues BEFORE starting full conversion

**Current State:**
System waits until AFTER full conversion ‚Üí NWB Inspector validation to discover issues.

- File is corrupted
- Wrong format detected

**Example Output (Failed Check):**
```
‚ùå PRE-FLIGHT CHECK FAILED

What's Wrong:
I can't detect a valid data format in your uploaded file. The file appears to be corrupted or is not a supported neurophysiology format.

Likely Cause:
This often happens when files are compressed or partially downloaded. The file header doesn't match any known format (SpikeGLX, Intan, OpenEphys, etc.).

How to Fix:
1. Check if the file is compressed (.zip, .tar.gz) - if so, extract it first
2. Try re-downloading from your acquisition system
3. Verify the file opens in your acquisition software (e.g., SpikeGLX viewer)

Recommendation:
Upload the UNCOMPRESSED .bin file from SpikeGLX, not the .zip archive.
```

**Impact:**
- Saves time (fail fast)
- Better error messages
- Reduces support burden
- Improves success rate

**ROI:** MEDIUM - Adds ~2s upfront, saves 5+ minutes on failures

## 3. Edge Cases & Missing Validations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case #1: Concurrent Chat Messages During LLM Processing

**Scenario:**
1. User uploads file
2. System starts LLM metadata inference (takes 10s)
3. User sends chat message "What's happening?"
4. System still processing LLM call from step 2
5. **BUG**: New chat message triggers second LLM call
6. Two concurrent LLM calls, undefined behavior

**Current Code Issue:**
[backend/src/api/main.py - chat endpoint](backend/src/api/main.py) doesn't check if LLM is busy

**Fix:**
```python
# Add to GlobalState
class GlobalState(BaseModel):
    llm_processing: bool = Field(default=False, description="LLM call in progress")
    _llm_lock: asyncio.Lock = PrivateAttr(default_factory=asyncio.Lock)

# In chat endpoint
@app.post("/api/chat")
async def chat_handler(message: str):
    if global_state.llm_processing:
        return {
            "status": "busy",
            "message": "I'm still thinking about your previous message. One moment...",
        }

    async with global_state._llm_lock:
        global_state.llm_processing = True
        try:
            result = await process_chat(message)
            return result
        finally:
            global_state.llm_processing = False
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case #2: User Uploads Multiple Files (Should Only Allow One)

**Scenario:**
Requirements.md specifies "single session" constraint, but frontend might allow multi-file upload.

**Validation Needed:**
```python
# In upload endpoint
@app.post("/api/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile):
    if not global_state.can_accept_upload():
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Conversion already in progress"}

    # NEW: Check file count
    if hasattr(file, '__iter__') and len(list(file)) > 1:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "message": "Please upload ONE file or directory at a time. Multiple file upload not supported in this version."
        }
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case #3: Page Refresh During LLM Metadata Request

**Scenario:**
1. User uploads file
2. System asks "Who was the experimenter?"
3. User refreshes page
4. Conversation history persists in backend
5. User sees blank chat
6. User confused, abandons

**Fix:**
```python
# In frontend page load
async function restoreConversation() {
    const status = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/status`).then(r => r.json());

    if (status.conversation_history && status.conversation_history.length > 0) {
        // Restore chat UI

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case #4: MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS Boundary (Attempt #5 vs #6)

**Scenario:**
- State: `correction_attempt = 4`, `can_retry = True`
- User approves retry
- Retry succeeds, but LLM still finds issues
- System increments to `correction_attempt = 5`
- **Question**: Is attempt #5 the last allowed, or is #6?

**Ambiguity:**
```python
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 5
can_retry = correction_attempt < MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS  # Is this correct?
```

If `correction_attempt starts at 0`:
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ‚Üí 5 attempts total (correct)
- But if someone reads "5 retries", they expect 6 total attempts

**Fix:**
Add explicit comment and test:
```python
class GlobalState(BaseModel):
    MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: int = 5
    """
    Maximum correction attempts allowed.

    Counting:
    - correction_attempt = 0: First try (not a retry)
    - correction_attempt = 1-5: Actual retries
    - Total attempts possible: 6 (1 initial + 5 retries)

    Boundary check:
    - can_retry = (correction_attempt < MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS)
    - When correction_attempt = 5, can_retry = False (no more retries)
    """
    correction_attempt: int = Field(default=0, ge=0, le=5)
```

**Test Case:**
```python
def test_max_retry_boundary():
    state = GlobalState(status=ConversionStatus.IDLE)

    # Initial attempt
    assert state.correction_attempt == 0
    assert state.can_retry == True

    # 5 retries
    for i in range(1, 6):
        state.correction_attempt = i
        state.can_retry = state.correction_attempt < state.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS

        if i < 5:
            assert state.can_retry == True, f"Attempt {i} should allow retry"
        else:
            assert state.can_retry == False, f"Attempt {i} should be last"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case #5: Extremely Large File Upload (OOM Risk)

**Scenario:**
User uploads 50GB SpikeGLX file, system tries to load entire file into memory for analysis.

**Current Risk:**
Metadata inference, format detection might read full file ‚Üí OOM crash

**Fix:**
```python
# In file analysis modules
class FileAnalyzer:
    MAX_READ_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100 MB max

    async def analyze_file(self, file_path: str) -> Dict:
        file_size = Path(file_path).stat().st_size

        if file_size > self.MAX_READ_SIZE:
            # Only read first 100MB for header analysis
            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
                sample = f.read(self.MAX_READ_SIZE)

            return {
                "format": self._detect_format_from_header(sample),
                "full_analysis": False,
                "note": f"File is {file_size / 1e9:.1f} GB - analyzed header only"
            }
        else:
            # Safe to read full file
            return self._full_analysis(file_path)
```

## 4. Architectural Improvements

### üîß Architecture #1: Event-Driven State Transitions with Observers

**Current Issue:**
State changes happen in multiple places, hard to track what triggers what.

**Proposed Pattern:**
```python
# Create new module: models/state_events.py
from enum import Enum
from typing import Callable, List
import asyncio

class StateEvent(Enum):
    """All possible state change events."""
    STATUS_CHANGED = "status_changed"
    VALIDATION_COMPLETED = "validation_completed"
    METADATA_COLLECTED = "metadata_collected"
    RETRY_APPROVED = "retry_approved"
    CONVERSION_FAILED = "conversion_failed"

class StateEventBus:
    """Pub-sub for state changes."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.listeners: Dict[StateEvent, List[Callable]] = {}

    def subscribe(self, event: StateEvent, handler: Callable):
        """Register handler for event."""
        if event not in self.listeners:
            self.listeners[event] = []
        self.listeners[event].append(handler)

    async def publish(self, event: StateEvent, data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Notify all listeners of event."""
        if event in self.listeners:
            tasks = [handler(data) for handler in self.listeners[event]]
            await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

# In GlobalState
class GlobalState(BaseModel):
    event_bus: StateEventBus = Field(default_factory=StateEventBus)

    def set_status(self, new_status: ConversionStatus):
        """Set status and notify subscribers."""
        old_status = self.status
        self.status = new_status

        # Publish event
        asyncio.create_task(self.event_bus.publish(
            StateEvent.STATUS_CHANGED,
            {"old": old_status, "new": new_status}
        ))

# Example listener in ConversationAgent
async def on_validation_completed(data: Dict):
    """React to validation completion."""
    if data["validation_result"].overall_status == ValidationOutcome.FAILED:
        # Automatically start retry analysis
        await self.analyze_retry_strategy(data)

# Register listener
global_state.event_bus.subscribe(
    StateEvent.VALIDATION_COMPLETED,
    on_validation_completed
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Decoupled components
- Easy to add new behaviors
- Clear data flow
- Auditable (all state changes logged)

---

### üîß Architecture #2: Prompt Templates as Config Files

**Current Issue:**
LLM prompts hardcoded in Python files, hard to iterate and improve.

**Proposed Pattern:**
```yaml
# prompts/metadata_inference.yaml
name: metadata_inference
version: 1.0
description: Infer missing metadata from file analysis

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert neuroscience metadata analyst.

  Given file information and partial user input, predict ALL missing DANDI metadata fields.
  For each prediction, provide:
  1. Predicted value
  2. Confidence score (0-100)
  3. Reasoning (why this prediction makes sense)

  Be conservative: Only predict if confidence >= {{min_confidence}}.
  Better to ask user than guess wrong.

user_prompt_template: |
  Predict missing metadata from this context:

  **File Analysis:**
  {{file_meta | json}}

  **User Provided So Far:**
  {{user_metadata | json}}

  **Heuristic Inferences:**
  {{heuristic_inferences | json}}

  **Required DANDI Fields:**
  {{required_fields | join(', ')}}

  For each MISSING required field, predict:
  - Most likely value based on context
  - Confidence (0-100)
  - Reasoning

parameters:
  min_confidence: 70
  temperature: 0.3
  max_tokens: 1000

output_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    predictions:
      type: object
      # ... schema definition
```

**Usage:**
```python
# New module: services/prompt_loader.py
import yaml
from jinja2 import Template

class PromptLoader:
    """Load and render prompt templates."""

    def load(self, name: str) -> Dict:
        """Load prompt config."""
        path = Path(f"prompts/{name}.yaml")
        with open(path) as f:
            return yaml.safe_load(f)

    def render(self, name: str, context: Dict) -> str:
        """Render prompt with context."""
        config = self.load(name)
        template = Template(config["user_prompt_template"])
        return template.render(**context)

# In MetadataInferenceEngine
prompt_loader = PromptLoader()

async def infer(self, ...):
    config = prompt_loader.load("metadata_inference")

    user_prompt = prompt_loader.render("metadata_inference", {
        "file_meta": file_meta,
        "user_metadata": state.metadata,
        "heuristic_inferences": heuristic_inferences,
        "required_fields": self.REQUIRED_FIELDS,
    })

    result = await self.llm_service.complete_structured(
        system=config["system_prompt"],
        user=user_prompt,
        output_schema=config["output_schema"],
        **config["parameters"]
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Non-engineers can improve prompts
- Version control for prompts
- A/B testing different prompts
- Reusable across agents

---

### üîß Architecture #3: Structured Logging with OpenTelemetry

**Current Issue:**
Logs are simple text, hard to analyze performance, trace requests across agents.

**Proposed Pattern:**
```python
# Use OpenTelemetry for structured logging + tracing
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor

# Setup
tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# In agent methods
async def handle_conversion(self, message, state):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("conversion_agent.handle_conversion") as span:
        span.set_attribute("file.path", state.input_path)
        span.set_attribute("file.format", detected_format)

        # Log events
        span.add_event("format_detected", {"format": detected_format})

        try:
            result = await self._run_neuroconv(...)
            span.set_attribute("conversion.success", True)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            span.set_attribute("conversion.success", False)
            span.record_exception(e)
            raise
```

**Benefits:**
- Trace requests across all 3 agents
- Measure LLM latency vs. conversion latency
- Identify bottlenecks
- Production-ready monitoring

---

### üîß Architecture #4: Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff for LLM Calls

**Current Issue:**
LLM calls fail ‚Üí immediate error. No retry for transient failures (rate limits, network issues).

**Proposed Pattern:**
```python
# In services/llm_service.py
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential, retry_if_exception_type

class LLMService:
    @retry(
        stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
        wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10),
        retry=retry_if_exception_type((RateLimitError, TimeoutError, ConnectionError)),
    )
    async def complete_structured(
        self,
        system: str,
        user: str,
        output_schema: Dict,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Dict:
        """Complete with structured output, auto-retry on failures."""
        try:
            response = await self.anthropic.messages.create(...)
            return self._parse_structured_output(response, output_schema)
        except RateLimitError as e:
            # Wait and retry (handled by tenacity decorator)
            logger.warning(f"Rate limit hit, retrying: {e}")
            raise
        except Exception as e:
            # Log and fail
            logger.error(f"LLM call failed: {e}")
            raise
```

**Benefits:**
- Resilient to transient failures
- Better user experience (no failures due to rate limits)
- Automatic backoff (don't hammer API)
