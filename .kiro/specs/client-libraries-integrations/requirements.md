# Client Libraries and Integrations Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on client libraries and external integrations that interact
with the MCP server. The primary client library (exemplified by workflow.py)
provides a Python interface for using the conversion pipeline, while external
integrations enable the system to work with other tools and workflows such as
Claude Code or a third-party web application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want example client
implementations for interacting with the MCP server, so that I can understand
how to integrate neuroscience data conversion into my workflows
programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning integration THEN the system SHALL provide example Python client
   code that demonstrates MCP server communication
2. WHEN understanding state management THEN examples SHALL show how to track
   conversion progress and maintain context across multiple tool calls
3. WHEN handling errors THEN examples SHALL demonstrate meaningful error
   handling patterns and recovery strategies
4. WHEN implementing workflows THEN examples SHALL show both step-by-step
   execution and full pipeline automation patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a non-technical researcher, I want AI assistance in the client interface, so that I can perform complex conversions without deep technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring conversions THEN the client SHALL provide AI-powered parameter recommendations based on dataset characteristics and experimental context
2. WHEN encountering errors THEN the client SHALL offer intelligent troubleshooting suggestions with specific remediation steps
3. WHEN optimizing workflows THEN the client SHALL learn from usage patterns and suggest improvements for conversion efficiency
4. WHEN documenting processes THEN the client SHALL auto-generate workflow documentation and tutorials in plain language
5. WHEN handling metadata THEN the client SHALL use AI to suggest missing metadata fields and validate experimental descriptions
6. WHEN selecting file mappings THEN the client SHALL intelligently recommend file-to-data-type mappings based on file analysis
7. WHEN reviewing results THEN the client SHALL provide AI-generated summaries of conversion quality and potential issues
8. WHEN learning the system THEN the client SHALL offer contextual help and guided tutorials based on user behavior patterns
