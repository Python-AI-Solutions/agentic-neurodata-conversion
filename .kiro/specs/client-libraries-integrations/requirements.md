# Client Libraries and Integrations Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on client libraries and external integrations that interact with the MCP server. The primary client library (exemplified by workflow.py) provides a Python interface for using the conversion pipeline, while external integrations enable the system to work with other tools and workflows such as Claude Code or a third-party web application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want example client implementations for interacting with the MCP server, so that I can understand how to integrate neuroscience data conversion into my workflows programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning integration THEN the system SHALL provide example Python client code that demonstrates MCP server communication
2. WHEN understanding state management THEN examples SHALL show how to track conversion progress and maintain context across multiple tool calls
3. WHEN handling errors THEN examples SHALL demonstrate meaningful error handling patterns and recovery strategies
4. WHEN implementing workflows THEN examples SHALL show both step-by-step execution and full pipeline automation patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want example client code that demonstrates the complete conversion workflow, so that I can understand how to convert datasets with minimal technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing examples THEN the system SHALL provide sample code showing pipeline initialization with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN learning workflows THEN examples SHALL demonstrate coordination with the MCP server for dataset analysis and metadata extraction
3. WHEN understanding conversion THEN examples SHALL show how to handle conversion script generation and execution through the MCP server
4. WHEN seeing evaluation THEN examples SHALL demonstrate triggering NWB validation and knowledge graph generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the client library to be configurable and extensible, so that I can adapt it to different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the client THEN it SHALL support different MCP server endpoints, output directories, and processing options
2. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the client SHALL allow configuration of timeouts, retry policies, and error handling strategies
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the client SHALL provide hooks for custom processing steps and result handling
4. WHEN integrating with other tools THEN the client SHALL provide clear interfaces for embedding in larger workflows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery in the client library, so that I can handle network issues and server errors gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the client SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
2. WHEN server errors occur THEN the client SHALL parse structured error responses and provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN partial failures happen THEN the client SHALL support resuming conversions from intermediate states
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the client SHALL provide detailed logging of all API interactions and state changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example usage patterns and documentation, so that I can quickly learn how to use the conversion pipeline effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the system THEN the client library SHALL include comprehensive examples showing common usage patterns
2. WHEN exploring functionality THEN the client SHALL provide clear documentation of all methods and configuration options
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the client SHALL include debugging utilities and diagnostic methods
4. WHEN getting started THEN the client SHALL provide quick-start examples that work with sample datasets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the client library to support monitoring and observability, so that I can track usage and performance in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running conversions THEN the client SHALL provide metrics on processing time, success rates, and resource usage
2. WHEN monitoring systems THEN the client SHALL support integration with logging and monitoring frameworks
3. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the client SHALL provide analytics on conversion patterns and common error conditions
4. WHEN debugging production issues THEN the client SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and state inspection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want integration capabilities that allow the conversion pipeline to work with external tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with notebooks THEN the client SHALL work seamlessly in Jupyter notebooks with appropriate progress indicators
2. WHEN integrating with workflows THEN the client SHALL support integration with workflow management systems (Snakemake, Nextflow, etc.)
3. WHEN integrating with data platforms THEN the client SHALL provide interfaces for working with cloud storage and data repositories
4. WHEN integrating with analysis tools THEN the client SHALL support exporting results in formats compatible with common neuroscience analysis tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example client code to be well-documented and testable, so that I can understand best practices and adapt them to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing examples THEN they SHALL include mock modes that demonstrate testing without requiring a running MCP server
2. WHEN learning testing THEN examples SHALL show test utilities for validating integration with the MCP server
3. WHEN understanding patterns THEN examples SHALL follow consistent patterns and demonstrate clear extension points
4. WHEN adapting code THEN examples SHALL include comprehensive documentation explaining the integration architecture

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the client library to handle different data scenarios gracefully, so that I can convert various types of neuroscience datasets reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with large datasets THEN the client SHALL handle long-running conversions with appropriate progress reporting
2. WHEN working with complex datasets THEN the client SHALL support multi-format datasets and complex experimental setups
3. WHEN working with problematic data THEN the client SHALL provide clear guidance on data preparation and common issues
4. WHEN working with different formats THEN the client SHALL automatically detect and handle various neuroscience data formats through the MCP server
