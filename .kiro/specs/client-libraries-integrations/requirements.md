# Client Libraries and Integrations Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on client libraries and external integrations that interact with the MCP server. The primary client library provides a Python interface for using the conversion pipeline, while external integrations enable the system to work with other tools and workflows such as Claude Code or a third-party web application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want example client
implementations for interacting with the MCP server, so that I can understand
how to integrate neuroscience data conversion into my workflows
programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning integration THEN the system SHALL provide example Python client
   code that demonstrates MCP server communication
2. WHEN understanding state management THEN examples SHALL show how to track
   conversion progress and maintain context across multiple tool calls
3. WHEN handling errors THEN examples SHALL demonstrate meaningful error
   handling patterns and recovery strategies
4. WHEN implementing workflows THEN examples SHALL show both step-by-step
   execution and full pipeline automation patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want example client code that demonstrates
the complete conversion workflow, so that I can understand how to convert
datasets with minimal technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing examples THEN the system SHALL provide sample code showing
   pipeline initialization with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN learning workflows THEN examples SHALL demonstrate coordination with the
   MCP server for dataset analysis and metadata extraction
3. WHEN understanding conversion THEN examples SHALL show how to handle
   conversion script generation and execution through the MCP server
4. WHEN seeing evaluation THEN examples SHALL demonstrate triggering NWB
   validation and knowledge graph generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery in the
client library, so that I can handle network issues and server errors
gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the client SHALL implement retry logic with
   exponential backoff for transient failures
2. WHEN server errors occur THEN the client SHALL parse structured error
   responses and provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN partial failures happen THEN the client SHALL support resuming
   conversions from intermediate states
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the client SHALL provide detailed logging of all
   API interactions and state changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example usage patterns and documentation,
so that I can quickly learn how to use the conversion pipeline effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the system THEN the client library SHALL include comprehensive
   examples showing common usage patterns
2. WHEN exploring functionality THEN the client SHALL provide clear
   documentation of all methods and configuration options
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the client SHALL include debugging utilities and
   diagnostic methods
4. WHEN getting started THEN the client SHALL provide quick-start examples that
   work with sample datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want integration capabilities that
allow the conversion pipeline to work with external tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with notebooks THEN the client SHALL work seamlessly in
   Jupyter notebooks with appropriate progress indicators
2. WHEN integrating with workflows THEN the client SHALL support integration
   with workflow management systems (Snakemake, Nextflow, etc.)
3. WHEN integrating with data platforms THEN the client SHALL provide interfaces
   for working with cloud storage and data repositories
4. WHEN integrating with analysis tools THEN the client SHALL support exporting
   results in formats compatible with common neuroscience analysis tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a non-technical researcher, I want AI assistance in the client interface, so that I can perform complex conversions without deep technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring conversions THEN the client SHALL provide AI-powered parameter recommendations based on dataset characteristics and experimental context
2. WHEN encountering errors THEN the client SHALL offer intelligent troubleshooting suggestions with specific remediation steps
3. WHEN optimizing workflows THEN the client SHALL learn from usage patterns and suggest improvements for conversion efficiency
4. WHEN documenting processes THEN the client SHALL auto-generate workflow documentation and tutorials in plain language
5. WHEN handling metadata THEN the client SHALL use AI to suggest missing metadata fields and validate experimental descriptions
6. WHEN selecting file mappings THEN the client SHALL intelligently recommend file-to-data-type mappings based on file analysis
7. WHEN reviewing results THEN the client SHALL provide AI-generated summaries of conversion quality and potential issues
8. WHEN learning the system THEN the client SHALL offer contextual help and guided tutorials based on user behavior patterns
