# Core Project Organization Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the foundational project structure, packaging, development tooling, and collaborative workflows for the agentic neurodata conversion project. The system is built around a central MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that orchestrates multi-agent workflows for converting neuroscience data to NWB format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure that reflects the MCP server as the primary orchestration layer, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical modules (etl for data creation and a package with dependencies managed in pyproject.toml using pixi containing core, agents, interfaces, utils etc.)
2. WHEN looking for functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between MCP server (primary orchestration with internal agents), client interface implementations, and external client libraries
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have designated directories for MCP tools, agent modules, and third-party client integrations
4. WHEN working with configuration THEN the system SHALL use pydantic-settings based configuration with nested classes and environment variable support

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent development patterns and best practices, so that the codebase maintains quality and consistency across MCP server, agents, and clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent coding standards through automated tools (ruff SHALL be used)
2. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL validate code quality through pre-commit hooks
3. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for MCP tool implementation, agent interfaces, and error handling
4. WHEN creating new modules THEN the system SHALL provide templates for MCP tools, agents, and client libraries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust development tooling optimized for MCP server development, so that I can work efficiently with the multi-agent architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing MCP tools THEN the system SHALL provide decorator-based tool registration (@mcp.tool) and testing utilities for MCP server development
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use modern package management with pixi with clear dependency specifications
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging for MCP server operations, tool executions, and agent interactions
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include containerization for the MCP server with configurable host/port settings via environment variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want collaborative development workflows that support the MCP-centric architecture, so that multiple developers can contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL provide clear branching and merge strategies for MCP server and agent development
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL include automated CI/CD pipelines that test MCP server functionality
3. WHEN managing releases THEN the system SHALL provide versioning for MCP server API and agent interfaces
4. WHEN onboarding THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive setup documentation for MCP server development

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic documentation infrastructure that explains the MCP-centric architecture, so that I can understand and contribute to the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the project THEN the system SHALL provide documentation explaining the MCP server's central role as the primary orchestration layer
2. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for developing MCP tools and agents
3. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive MCP server setup and testing instructions
4. WHEN understanding the architecture THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of the MCP server as central orchestrator with agents managed internally and multiple client interface options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the MCP server to provide tool registration and discovery mechanisms, so that agents and functionality can be dynamically registered and discovered by clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering tools THEN the MCP server SHALL provide a decorator-based registration system (@mcp.tool) for dynamic tool discovery
2. WHEN clients query available tools THEN the MCP server SHALL expose endpoints for listing registered tools and their capabilities
3. WHEN tools are executed THEN the MCP server SHALL route requests to registered tool functions with proper error handling
4. WHEN managing tool state THEN the MCP server SHALL maintain lightweight state between tool executions within pipeline workflows

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want example client implementations for consuming the MCP server, so that I can understand how to integrate the conversion pipeline into external tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning to integrate THEN the system SHALL provide Python client examples (like workflow.py) demonstrating MCP server interaction patterns
2. WHEN reviewing examples THEN the documentation SHALL show proper error handling and status checking patterns for MCP server responses
3. WHEN understanding state management THEN examples SHALL demonstrate tracking conversion state (normalized_metadata, nwb_path) across multiple tool calls
4. WHEN implementing workflows THEN examples SHALL illustrate step-by-step pipeline execution with intermediate result validation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure that covers MCP server functionality and client integration patterns, so that I can ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing MCP tools THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for individual tool registration and execution
2. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL include integration tests that validate end-to-end pipeline workflows using example client patterns
3. WHEN testing with real data THEN the system SHALL make use of datalad to track datasets used in testing and consider datasets suggested in documents/possible-datasets
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage reporting for MCP server tools and client library functionality
