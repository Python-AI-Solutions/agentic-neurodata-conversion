# Core Project Organization Requirements

## Introduction

The agentic neurodata conversion project provides support for scientists to conver their lab data to NWB format. This is done through a multi-agent system that orchestrates the conversion process. The functionality is exposed using an MCP server and makes use of validation systems, domain specific ontoloogies, pre-existing conversion examples, and ecosystem tools for this task.

The project structure must balance monorepo advantages for core components with clear boundaries for external integrations, support multiple development workflows from local debugging to cloud deployment. The MCP server exposes dataset analysis capabilities, conversion orchestration tools, and workflow handoff mechanisms, which delegate tasks to internal agent modules. We must maintain consistency across a complex multi-agent architecture while enabling independent component evolution.

## Requirements

2. WHEN looking for functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between MCP server components (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/mcp_server/` with `core/`, `adapters/`, `tools/`), internal agent modules (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/agents/` with `conversation/`, `conversion/`, `evaluation/`, `questioner/`), client interface implementations (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/clients/` with protocol-specific clients), external client libraries (`external/` or separate repositories), shared utilities (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/utils/`), domain models (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/models/`), and configuration management (`src/agentic_nwb_converter/config/`)
