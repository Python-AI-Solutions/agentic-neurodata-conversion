# Evaluation and Reporting Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on evaluation and reporting systems that generate
comprehensive assessments, interactive visualizations, and human-readable
summaries of conversion results. This includes quality reports, context
summaries, interactive visualizations, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks
that help users understand and validate their conversion results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive evaluation reports that
summarize conversion quality and provide actionable insights, so that I can
understand and validate my conversion results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversions complete THEN the evaluation system SHALL generate
   comprehensive quality reports including metadata completeness, validation
   results, and quality metrics
2. WHEN providing insights THEN the evaluation system SHALL identify strengths
   and weaknesses in the conversion with specific recommendations for
   improvement
3. WHEN summarizing results THEN the evaluation system SHALL create executive
   summaries suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences
4. WHEN tracking provenance THEN the evaluation system SHALL clearly document
   the source and confidence level of all metadata fields

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want interactive visualizations of my
converted data, so that I can explore and validate the conversion results
visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating visualizations THEN the evaluation system SHALL create
   interactive HTML visualizations of knowledge graphs, metadata relationships,
   and data structure
2. WHEN exploring data THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide faceted browsing
   and filtering capabilities for complex datasets
3. WHEN validating relationships THEN the evaluation system SHALL visualize
   entity relationships and allow interactive exploration of semantic
   connections
4. WHEN providing context THEN the evaluation system SHALL include contextual
   information and explanations within interactive visualizations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want human-readable context summaries that
explain conversion decisions and data relationships, so that I can quickly
understand and validate automated conversions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating summaries THEN the evaluation system SHALL generate
   human-readable context summaries that explain conversion decisions and
   reasoning
2. WHEN describing relationships THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide clear
   explanations of how entities relate to each other in natural language
3. WHEN explaining decisions THEN the evaluation system SHALL document why
   specific conversion choices were made and what alternatives were considered
4. WHEN providing transparency THEN the evaluation system SHALL clearly
   distinguish between automated decisions and user-provided information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want evaluation systems that assess
conversion completeness and identify areas for improvement, so that I can
systematically improve data quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing completeness THEN the evaluation system SHALL identify missing
   metadata fields, incomplete data sections, and potential quality issues
2. WHEN prioritizing improvements THEN the evaluation system SHALL rank issues
   by importance and impact on data usability
3. WHEN providing guidance THEN the evaluation system SHALL suggest specific
   actions for addressing identified issues
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the evaluation system SHALL support comparison of
   evaluation results across multiple conversion iterations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want evaluation systems that integrate
with the conversion pipeline and provide structured outputs, so that evaluation
results can be consumed by other tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with MCP server THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide
   evaluation tools accessible through standard MCP endpoints
2. WHEN generating outputs THEN the evaluation system SHALL produce structured
   evaluation results in machine-readable formats (JSON, XML, RDF)
3. WHEN providing APIs THEN the evaluation system SHALL offer programmatic
   access to evaluation metrics and results
4. WHEN supporting workflows THEN the evaluation system SHALL integrate with
   external analysis tools and reporting systems

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want evaluation systems that support
different evaluation perspectives, so that I can assess conversion quality from
multiple viewpoints (technical, scientific, usability).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing technical evaluation THEN the evaluation system SHALL assess
   schema compliance, data integrity, and technical quality metrics
2. WHEN providing scientific evaluation THEN the evaluation system SHALL assess
   scientific validity, experimental completeness, and domain-specific quality
3. WHEN providing usability evaluation THEN the evaluation system SHALL assess
   data discoverability, documentation quality, and ease of use
4. WHEN combining perspectives THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide
   integrated assessments that balance technical, scientific, and usability
   concerns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want evaluation systems that
provide benchmarking and comparative analysis, so that I can track quality
improvements and compare conversion approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarking quality THEN the evaluation system SHALL compare conversion
   results against established quality benchmarks and best practices
2. WHEN providing comparisons THEN the evaluation system SHALL support
   comparison of different conversion approaches or parameter settings
3. WHEN tracking trends THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide analytics on
   quality trends over time and across different datasets
4. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the evaluation system SHALL highlight common
   quality patterns and suggest systematic improvements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want evaluation systems that are extensible
and configurable, so that evaluation criteria can be customized for different
use cases and evolving requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring evaluation THEN the evaluation system SHALL support custom
   evaluation metrics and quality criteria
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide plugin
   architectures for adding new evaluation methods
3. WHEN customizing reports THEN the evaluation system SHALL allow customization
   of report formats, content, and presentation
4. WHEN adapting to requirements THEN the evaluation system SHALL support
   different evaluation profiles for different use cases (research, clinical,
   regulatory)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want evaluation systems that support
collaborative review and validation, so that domain experts can review and
approve conversion results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN supporting collaboration THEN the evaluation system SHALL provide
   interfaces for expert review and annotation of conversion results
2. WHEN facilitating review THEN the evaluation system SHALL highlight areas
   that require expert attention and provide review workflows
3. WHEN capturing feedback THEN the evaluation system SHALL record expert
   feedback and incorporate it into evaluation results
4. WHEN managing approval THEN the evaluation system SHALL support approval
   workflows and track the status of expert reviews
