# Evaluation and Reporting Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the evaluation and reporting systems that assess conversion quality through systematic analysis and provide comprehensive reporting capabilities for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The evaluation system starts with nwb-inspector validation, followed by multi-dimensional quality assessment across technical, scientific, and usability dimensions, and concludes with comprehensive reporting and interactive visualization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - NWB Validation Foundation

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want reliable NWB file validation with automatic fallback capabilities, so that I can ensure data quality even when primary validation tools are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nwb-inspector is available THEN the system SHALL execute nwb-inspector with configurable parameters and parse JSON output into structured results with timeout handling and error recovery
2. WHEN circuit breaker protection is active THEN the system SHALL immediately use fallback validation without attempting nwb-inspector and provide clear error messages with recovery guidance

### Requirement 2 - Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive quality assessment across technical, scientific, and usability dimensions, so that I can understand the complete quality profile of my NWB data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing technical quality THEN the system SHALL evaluate schema compliance, data integrity, structure quality, and performance characteristics with detailed scoring and specific remediation recommendations
2. WHEN evaluating scientific quality THEN the system SHALL assess experimental completeness against domain standards, validate experimental design consistency, and evaluate documentation adequacy with domain-specific improvement suggestions
3. WHEN analyzing usability quality THEN the system SHALL assess documentation clarity, evaluate searchability and metadata richness, check accessibility compliance, and suggest user experience improvements using natural language processing metrics

### Requirement 3 - Quality Assessment Orchestration

**User Story:** As a quality manager, I want coordinated quality assessment with configurable weights and parallel execution, so that I can obtain comprehensive quality insights efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orchestrating evaluation THEN the system SHALL coordinate all evaluator modules with proper dependency management and support parallel execution of independent evaluators
2. WHEN aggregating results THEN the system SHALL apply configurable weights, combine scores appropriately, and produce actionable recommendations based on comprehensive analysis
3. WHEN evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with partial results, maintain evaluation audit trails for traceability, and provide real-time progress reporting

### Requirement 4 - Comprehensive Reporting

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want flexible reporting capabilities with multiple output formats, so that I can communicate quality results effectively to different audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create executive summaries suitable for non-technical audiences and detailed technical reports with metrics, validation results, and recommendations
2. WHEN formatting outputs THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF, JSON) with custom report templates, variable substitution, and consistent formatting across all output formats
3. WHEN customizing reports THEN the system SHALL apply templates and branding configuration while optimizing report size and preserving essential information

### Requirement 5 - Simple HTML Visualization

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want simple HTML quality reports with basic visualizations, so that I can quickly review quality metrics in any web browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate simple HTML reports with embedded charts using lightweight JavaScript libraries
2. WHEN presenting metrics THEN the system SHALL use basic chart types (bar, line, pie) with clear color coding and responsive HTML layout
3. WHEN accessing reports THEN the system SHALL ensure HTML files work offline without external dependencies and display correctly

### Requirement 6 - MCP Server Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want evaluation and reporting systems that integrate cleanly with the MCP server and agents, so that quality assessment can be seamlessly incorporated into conversion workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called by agents THEN the system SHALL provide clean APIs for evaluation services through standard MCP protocol with input validation and structured responses
2. WHEN integrating with MCP server THEN the system SHALL expose functionality through appropriate MCP tools and handle concurrent evaluation requests with proper isolation
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL coordinate with all dependent modules efficiently, respond to health checks within 1 second, and provide request/response logging for monitoring
