# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec defines a comprehensive knowledge graph system that evolves from proven data conversion patterns toward full semantic knowledge management. The system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical ontology source, ensuring consistency and interoperability across the NWB ecosystem. It implements a phased approach: starting with schema-consistent data conversion (Phase 1), adding semantic enrichment capabilities (Phase 2), and culminating in advanced knowledge management features (Phase 3).

The architecture integrates three key insights:
1. **Proven Data Conversion**: Building on MVP patterns for reliable NWB-to-RDF conversion
2. **Schema-First Consistency**: Using NWB-LinkML as the single source of truth for structure and validation
3. **Rich Semantic Capabilities**: Providing metadata enrichment, provenance tracking, and complex querying

This approach ensures immediate value through basic conversion capabilities while establishing the foundation for advanced semantic features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Schema-Consistent Data Conversion (Phase 1 Foundation)

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want reliable NWB-to-RDF conversion that uses consistent schemas and validation, so that my knowledge graphs are interoperable and structurally sound.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting NWB files THEN the system SHALL use NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical source for structure definitions and IRI generation
2. WHEN generating RDF THEN the system SHALL use JSON-LD context derived from NWB-LinkML schema to ensure consistent URIs across all conversions
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL perform LinkML instance validation followed by SHACL graph validation using shapes generated from the same schema
4. WHEN tracking schema versions THEN the system SHALL record NWB-LinkML schema version and artifact hashes in PROV-O provenance metadata
5. WHEN producing outputs THEN the system SHALL generate multiple RDF formats (TTL, JSON-LD, N-Triples) with consistent structure and reliable conversion patterns proven in MVP implementation

### Requirement 2: Semantic Enrichment and Validation (Phase 2 Enhancement)

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want metadata enrichment with evidence-based confidence scoring, so that I can automatically fill gaps while maintaining data quality and traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata has gaps THEN the system SHALL suggest enrichments based on strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental protocols with evidence quality assessment
2. WHEN making suggestions THEN the system SHALL provide confidence levels, reasoning chains, and evidence hierarchy with support for iterative refinement workflows
3. WHEN storing relationships THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic entities (Dataset, Session, Subject, Device, Lab, Protocol) with relationships defined by NWB-LinkML schema
4. WHEN tracking decisions THEN the system SHALL record evidence-based decision making with human override tracking and conflict detection using PROV-O ontology
5. WHEN validating enrichments THEN the system SHALL use SPARQL queries for complex validation rules and biological plausibility checks

### Requirement 3: Advanced Knowledge Management (Phase 3 Full Capabilities)

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want advanced knowledge graph capabilities including ontology integration and federated queries, so that I can leverage the full power of semantic web technologies for neuroscience research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating domain knowledge THEN the system SHALL incorporate established neuroscience ontologies (NIFSTD, UBERON) aligned to NWB-LinkML classes and slots
2. WHEN reasoning about data THEN the system SHALL use domain-specific reasoning rules for neuroscience concepts and biological plausibility validation
3. WHEN querying across sources THEN the system SHALL support federated SPARQL queries across multiple knowledge sources with result aggregation
4. WHEN exploring knowledge THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations and faceted browsing capabilities with schema-aware navigation
5. WHEN managing evolution THEN the system SHALL support knowledge graph versioning, change tracking, and schema migration with artifact regeneration

### Requirement 4: System Integration and APIs (Cross-Phase)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean integration between knowledge graph systems and the broader conversion pipeline, so that semantic capabilities are seamlessly available to agents and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called by agents THEN the system SHALL provide MCP tools for knowledge graph generation, metadata enrichment, and validation with schema-aware APIs
2. WHEN integrating with conversion pipeline THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access, maintain consistency, and provide structured responses compatible with agent workflows
3. WHEN exposing functionality THEN the system SHALL provide SPARQL endpoints, REST APIs, and export services for programmatic access to knowledge graph data
4. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL create human-readable summaries, interactive visualizations, and multiple export formats for different consumption patterns
5. WHEN integrating with DataLad THEN the system SHALL correlate semantic provenance with file-level provenance for complete audit trails

### Requirement 5: Quality Assurance and Maintenance (Cross-Phase)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust quality assurance and maintenance capabilities, so that the knowledge graph system remains reliable and performant as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing schema artifacts THEN the system SHALL regenerate JSON-LD contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF/OWL artifacts when NWB-LinkML schema updates, storing them with version metadata
2. WHEN loading artifacts THEN the system SHALL pin schema versions and record them in PROV-O provenance for complete traceability
3. WHEN detecting issues THEN the system SHALL provide tools for consistency checking, gap identification, and automated quality improvement suggestions
4. WHEN scaling operations THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets efficiently with appropriate storage, indexing, and caching of versioned artifacts
5. WHEN monitoring systems THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on query performance, storage usage, validation success rates, and enrichment quality

### Requirement 6: Phased Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a clear implementation roadmap that delivers value incrementally, so that we can build confidence and gather feedback while progressing toward full capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Phase 1 THEN the system SHALL deliver reliable NWB-to-RDF conversion with schema consistency, building on proven MVP patterns
2. WHEN implementing Phase 2 THEN the system SHALL add metadata enrichment and semantic validation capabilities while maintaining Phase 1 reliability
3. WHEN implementing Phase 3 THEN the system SHALL provide advanced features like ontology integration and federated queries without disrupting existing functionality
4. WHEN transitioning between phases THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide clear migration paths for existing data and workflows
5. WHEN validating each phase THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable improvements in data quality, consistency, and user capabilities
