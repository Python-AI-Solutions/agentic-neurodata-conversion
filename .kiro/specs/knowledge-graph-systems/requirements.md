# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the knowledge graph systems that enrich metadata, provide
semantic relationships, and enable complex queries for the agentic neurodata
conversion pipeline. The knowledge graph system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the
canonical ontology source for NWB data, generating JSON-LD contexts, SHACL
shapes, and RDF/OWL from the schema. It maintains entities, relationships, and
provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment through external
references and domain knowledge.

   confidence levels, complete reasoning chains, evidence hierarchy, and support
   for iterative refinement workflows
3. WHEN storing relationships THEN the knowledge graph SHALL maintain entities
   (Dataset, Session, Subject, Device, Lab, Protocol) with semantic
   relationships and complete provenance using PROV-O ontology and LinkML schema
   versioning metadata
