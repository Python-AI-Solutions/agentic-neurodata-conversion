# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the knowledge graph systems that enrich metadata, provide semantic relationships, and enable complex queries for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The knowledge graph system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical ontology source for NWB data, generating JSON-LD contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF/OWL from the schema. It maintains entities, relationships, and provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment through external references and domain knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Metadata Enrichment

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a knowledge graph system that enriches my metadata using external references and domain knowledge, so that missing information can be automatically filled with high confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata has gaps THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to suggest enrichments based on strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental protocols with evidence quality assessment and conflict detection
2. WHEN making suggestions THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to provide enhanced confidence levels, complete reasoning chains, evidence hierarchy, and support for iterative refinement workflows
3. WHEN storing relationships THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to maintain entities (Dataset, Session, Subject, Device, Lab, Protocol) with semantic relationships and complete provenance using PROV-O ontology and LinkML schema versioning metadata

### Requirement 2 - SPARQL Query Engine

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want SPARQL query capabilities for complex metadata validation and enrichment rules, so that I can implement sophisticated data quality checks and automated enrichment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying knowledge THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to support SPARQL queries for complex metadata validation and enrichment rules; SHACL shapes generated
   from NWB-LinkML SHALL be used for structural validation
2. WHEN implementing rules THEN system SHALL use knowledge graph to allow definition of custom validation rules and enrichment patterns
3. WHEN executing queries THEN system SHALL use knowledge graph to provide efficient query execution with appropriate indexing and optimization

### Requirement 3 - Schema-driven Validation

**User Story:** As a standards engineer, I want schema-driven validation so that NWB data is validated consistently across pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating instances THEN the system SHALL validate LinkML instances (YAML/JSON) against the NWB-LinkML schema
2. WHEN producing RDF THEN the system SHALL generate RDF using the refrence from the NWB-LinkML schema to ensure consistent IRIs
3. WHEN validating graphs THEN the system SHALL run SHACL validation using shapes generated from the NWB-LinkML schema and produce detailed reports

### Requirement 4 - Basic RDF Generation

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want knowledge graph generation in
key formats, so that the semantic information can be consumed by different tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating knowledge graphs THEN the system SHALL produce JSON-LD with schema-derived @context and TTL formats
2. WHEN providing access THEN the system SHALL expose knowledge graphs through standard semantic web protocols (SPARQL endpoints)
3. WHEN integrating with tools THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for
   programmatic access to knowledge graph data

### Requirement 5 - Core NWB Ontology Integration

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want the knowledge graph to provide core ontology integration for NWB data, so that neuroscience concepts are semantically rich and scientifically accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing NWB data THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to integrate core neuroscience ontologies including NIFSTD (Neuroscience Information Framework), UBERON (anatomy), CHEBI (chemical entities), and NCBITaxon (species) with basic
   concept mapping and semantic bridging
2. WHEN creating semantic mappings THEN system SHALL use knowledge graph to  establish basic relationships between NWB-LinkML classes/slots and ontology concepts using OWL equivalence and subsumption with confidence scoring

### Requirement 6- MCP Server Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want knowledge graph systems that integrate cleanly with the MCP server and agents, so that semantic enrichment can be seamlessly incorporated into conversion workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queried by agents THEN system SHALL use knowledge graph to provide clean APIs for metadata enrichment and validation, including schema/shape validation APIs
2. WHEN integrating with MCP server THEN system SHALL use knowledge graph to expose functionality through appropriate MCP tools
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to handle concurrent access and maintain consistency
4. WHEN providing results THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph to return structured responses compatible with agent and MCP server interfaces

### Requirement 7 - Schema and Artifact Management

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want schema and artifact management so that schema updates propagate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating NWB-LinkML schema THEN the system SHALL regenerate JSON-LD contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF/OWL artifacts and store them with version metadata
2. WHEN loading artifacts THEN the system SHALL pin the schema version used and record it in PROV-O provenance for downstream triples

### Requirement 8 - Basic Dynamic Content Handling

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the knowledge graph system to handle
basic NWB content that extends beyond the standard schema, so that core experimental data and metadata can be captured and represented semantically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering unknown NWB data structures THEN the system SHALL automatically discover basic entity types and properties through runtime schema analysis including neurodata_type detection and structural pattern recognition
2. WHEN processing basic metadata fields THEN the system SHALL create adaptive RDF representations that preserve data types and maintain basic semantic relationships

### Requirement 9 - Basic Data Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want basic data quality
assurance and lineage tracking, so that I can trust the knowledge
graph data and understand the provenance of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide basic quality scoring with configurable thresholds and detailed quality reports with specific issue identification
2. WHEN tracking data lineage THEN the system SHALL maintain basic
   transformation chains from raw NWB to final RDF and capture enrichment decisions with evidence trails
