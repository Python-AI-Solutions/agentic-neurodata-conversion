# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the knowledge graph systems that enrich metadata, provide
semantic relationships, and enable complex queries for the agentic neurodata
conversion pipeline. The knowledge graph system maintains entities,
relationships, and provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment
through external references and domain knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a knowledge graph system that enriches
my metadata using external references and domain knowledge, so that missing
information can be automatically filled with high confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata has gaps THEN the knowledge graph SHALL suggest enrichments based on strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental protocols with evidence quality assessment and conflict detection
2. WHEN making suggestions THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide enhanced confidence levels, complete reasoning chains, evidence hierarchy, and support for iterative refinement workflows
3. WHEN storing relationships THEN the knowledge graph SHALL maintain entities (Dataset, Session, Subject, Device, Lab, Protocol) with semantic relationships and complete provenance using PROV-O ontology
4. WHEN tracking provenance THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support evidence-based decision making with human override tracking, evidence conflict detection, and integration with DataLad file-level provenance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want SPARQL query capabilities for complex
metadata validation and enrichment rules, so that I can implement sophisticated
data quality checks and automated enrichment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support SPARQL queries
   for complex metadata validation and enrichment rules
2. WHEN implementing rules THEN the knowledge graph SHALL allow definition of
   custom validation rules and enrichment patterns
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide efficient query
   execution with appropriate indexing and optimization
4. WHEN managing complexity THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support federated
   queries across multiple knowledge sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want knowledge graph generation in
multiple formats, so that the semantic information can be consumed by different
tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating knowledge graphs THEN the system SHALL produce multiple RDF
   formats (TTL, JSON-LD, N-Triples, RDF/XML)
2. WHEN creating outputs THEN the system SHALL generate human-readable triple
   summaries with entity labels and descriptions
3. WHEN providing access THEN the system SHALL expose knowledge graphs through
   standard semantic web protocols (SPARQL endpoints)
4. WHEN integrating with tools THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for
   programmatic access to knowledge graph data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want the knowledge graph to incorporate
neuroscience domain knowledge, so that enrichments are scientifically accurate
and contextually appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enriching metadata THEN the knowledge graph SHALL incorporate
   established neuroscience ontologies (NIFSTD, UBERON, etc.)
2. WHEN making inferences THEN the knowledge graph SHALL use domain-specific
   reasoning rules for neuroscience concepts
3. WHEN validating relationships THEN the knowledge graph SHALL enforce domain
   constraints and biological plausibility
4. WHEN updating knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support integration of
   new domain knowledge and ontology updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want knowledge graph systems that integrate
cleanly with the MCP server and agents, so that semantic enrichment can be
seamlessly incorporated into conversion workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called by agents THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide clean APIs for
   metadata enrichment and validation
2. WHEN integrating with MCP server THEN the knowledge graph SHALL expose
   functionality through appropriate MCP tools
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the knowledge graph SHALL handle concurrent
   access and maintain consistency
4. WHEN providing results THEN the knowledge graph SHALL return structured
   responses compatible with agent and MCP server interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want interactive knowledge graph exploration,
so that I can understand the semantic relationships in my data and validate
automated enrichments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring data THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide interactive
   visualizations of entities and relationships
2. WHEN validating enrichments THEN the knowledge graph SHALL show the reasoning
   path and evidence for automated suggestions
3. WHEN browsing knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide faceted search
   and filtering capabilities
4. WHEN understanding context THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide contextual
   information and related entity suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want knowledge graph systems that
are maintainable and scalable, so that they can handle growing datasets and
evolving domain knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing data THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support incremental updates
   and version control of knowledge bases
2. WHEN scaling systems THEN the knowledge graph SHALL handle large datasets
   efficiently with appropriate storage and indexing
3. WHEN maintaining quality THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide tools for
   detecting and resolving inconsistencies
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide metrics on
   query performance, storage usage, and update frequency
