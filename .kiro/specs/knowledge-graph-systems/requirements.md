# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the knowledge graph systems that enrich metadata, provide
semantic relationships, and enable complex queries for the agentic neurodata
conversion pipeline. The knowledge graph system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the
canonical ontology source for NWB data, generating JSON-LD contexts, SHACL
shapes, and RDF/OWL from the schema. It maintains entities, relationships, and
provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment through external
references and domain knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a knowledge graph system that enriches
my metadata using external references and domain knowledge, so that missing
information can be automatically filled with high confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata has gaps THEN the knowledge graph SHALL suggest enrichments
   based on strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental
   protocols with evidence quality assessment and conflict detection
2. WHEN making suggestions THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide enhanced
   confidence levels, complete reasoning chains, evidence hierarchy, and support
   for iterative refinement workflows
3. WHEN storing relationships THEN the knowledge graph SHALL maintain entities
   (Dataset, Session, Subject, Device, Lab, Protocol) with semantic
   relationships and complete provenance using PROV-O ontology and LinkML schema
   versioning metadata
4. WHEN tracking provenance THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support
   evidence-based decision making with human override tracking, evidence
   conflict detection, and integration with DataLad file-level provenance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want SPARQL query capabilities for complex
metadata validation and enrichment rules, so that I can implement sophisticated
data quality checks and automated enrichment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support SPARQL queries
   for complex metadata validation and enrichment rules; SHACL shapes generated
   from NWB-LinkML SHALL be used for structural validation
2. WHEN implementing rules THEN the knowledge graph SHALL allow definition of
   custom validation rules and enrichment patterns
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide efficient query
   execution with appropriate indexing and optimization
4. WHEN managing complexity THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support federated
   queries across multiple knowledge sources

### Requirement 2b (Schema-driven Validation)

**User Story:** As a standards engineer, I want schema-driven validation so that
NWB data is validated consistently across pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating instances THEN the system SHALL validate LinkML instances
   (YAML/JSON) against the NWB-LinkML schema
2. WHEN producing RDF THEN the system SHALL generate RDF using the JSON-LD
   @context produced from the NWB-LinkML schema to ensure consistent IRIs
3. WHEN validating graphs THEN the system SHALL run SHACL validation using
   shapes generated from the NWB-LinkML schema and produce detailed reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want knowledge graph generation in
multiple formats, so that the semantic information can be consumed by different
tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating knowledge graphs THEN the system SHALL produce multiple RDF
   formats (TTL, JSON-LD with schema-derived @context, N-Triples, RDF/XML)
2. WHEN creating outputs THEN the system SHALL generate human-readable triple
   summaries with entity labels and descriptions
3. WHEN providing access THEN the system SHALL expose knowledge graphs through
   standard semantic web protocols (SPARQL endpoints)
4. WHEN integrating with tools THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for
   programmatic access to knowledge graph data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want the knowledge graph to incorporate
neuroscience domain knowledge, so that enrichments are scientifically accurate
and contextually appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enriching metadata THEN the knowledge graph SHALL incorporate
   established neuroscience ontologies (NIFSTD, UBERON, etc.) and align them to
   NWB-LinkML classes/slots
2. WHEN making inferences THEN the knowledge graph SHALL use domain-specific
   reasoning rules for neuroscience concepts
3. WHEN validating relationships THEN the knowledge graph SHALL enforce domain
   constraints and biological plausibility
4. WHEN updating knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support integration of
   new domain knowledge and ontology updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want knowledge graph systems that integrate
cleanly with the MCP server and agents, so that semantic enrichment can be
seamlessly incorporated into conversion workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called by agents THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide clean APIs for
   metadata enrichment and validation, including schema/shape validation APIs
2. WHEN integrating with MCP server THEN the knowledge graph SHALL expose
   functionality through appropriate MCP tools
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the knowledge graph SHALL handle concurrent
   access and maintain consistency
4. WHEN providing results THEN the knowledge graph SHALL return structured
   responses compatible with agent and MCP server interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want interactive knowledge graph exploration,
so that I can understand the semantic relationships in my data and validate
automated enrichments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring data THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide interactive
   visualizations of entities and relationships
2. WHEN validating enrichments THEN the knowledge graph SHALL show the reasoning
   path and evidence for automated suggestions
3. WHEN browsing knowledge THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide faceted search
   and filtering capabilities with schema-aware facets derived from NWB-LinkML
4. WHEN understanding context THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide contextual
   information and related entity suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want knowledge graph systems that
are maintainable and scalable, so that they can handle growing datasets and
evolving domain knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing data THEN the knowledge graph SHALL support incremental updates
   and version control of knowledge bases
2. WHEN scaling systems THEN the knowledge graph SHALL handle large datasets
   efficiently with appropriate storage and indexing; JSON-LD contexts and
   SHACL shapes SHALL be cached and versioned
3. WHEN maintaining quality THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide tools for
   detecting and resolving inconsistencies
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the knowledge graph SHALL provide metrics on
   query performance, storage usage, and update frequency

### Requirement 8 (Schema and Artifact Management)

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want schema and artifact management so that
schema updates propagate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating NWB-LinkML schema THEN the system SHALL regenerate JSON-LD
   contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF/OWL artifacts and store them with version
   metadata
2. WHEN loading artifacts THEN the system SHALL pin the schema version used and
   record it in PROV-O provenance for downstream triples
3. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide migration guidance
   and compatibility reporting
