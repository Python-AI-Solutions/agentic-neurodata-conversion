# Knowledge Graph Systems Requirements

## Introduction

This spec defines a unified knowledge graph system that provides semantic enrichment, metadata validation, and relationship modeling for neuroscience data conversion. The system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical source for consistency and interoperability, building on proven MVP conversion patterns while adding rich semantic capabilities including metadata enrichment, provenance tracking, and complex querying.

The architecture integrates three key insights:
1. **NWB-LinkML Schema-First Architecture**: Use NWB-LinkML as the single source of truth for consistent IRIs and validation
2. **Proven Data Conversion Patterns**: Build on reliable MVP conversion logic for NWB-to-RDF transformation  
3. **Rich Semantic Capabilities**: Provide metadata enrichment, provenance tracking, and complex querying as core integrated features

This unified approach delivers immediate value through schema-consistent conversion while providing advanced semantic features as part of a single coherent product.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Schema Consistency and Reliable Conversion

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want all my NWB conversions to use consistent schemas and IRIs so that knowledge graphs from different sources can be combined and queried together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting NWB files THEN the system SHALL use NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical source for structure definitions and IRI generation
2. WHEN generating RDF THEN the system SHALL use JSON-LD context derived from NWB-LinkML schema to ensure consistent URIs across all conversions
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL perform LinkML instance validation followed by SHACL graph validation using shapes generated from the same schema
4. WHEN tracking schema versions THEN the system SHALL record NWB-LinkML schema version and artifact hashes in PROV-O provenance metadata
5. WHEN producing outputs THEN the system SHALL generate multiple RDF formats (TTL, JSON-LD, N-Triples) with consistent structure using proven MVP conversion patterns

### Requirement 2: Robust Conversion with Validation and Error Reporting

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want robust NWB-to-RDF conversion with validation and error reporting so that I can trust the semantic representation of my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing NWB files THEN the system SHALL validate structure against LinkML schema before conversion with clear error messages
2. WHEN generating RDF THEN the system SHALL validate output against SHACL shapes with detailed validation reports
3. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with fix suggestions and recovery options
4. WHEN conversion succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide quality metrics including completeness, consistency, and validation scores
5. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with sub-second response for typical operations

### Requirement 3: Semantic Enrichment with Evidence Tracking

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want automatic metadata enrichment with evidence tracking so that gaps in my data are filled with scientifically accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata has gaps THEN the system SHALL suggest enrichments based on strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental protocols
2. WHEN making enrichments THEN the system SHALL provide confidence levels, reasoning chains, and evidence hierarchy with source attribution
3. WHEN detecting conflicts THEN the system SHALL identify and flag inconsistent metadata with resolution suggestions
4. WHEN users override suggestions THEN the system SHALL support manual corrections with complete provenance tracking
5. WHEN enriching iteratively THEN the system SHALL support refinement workflows that improve metadata quality over time

### Requirement 4: Quality Assurance and Comprehensive Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation and quality metrics so that I can ensure data integrity and system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing schema artifacts THEN the system SHALL regenerate JSON-LD contexts, SHACL shapes, and OWL ontologies when NWB-LinkML schema updates
2. WHEN validating knowledge graphs THEN the system SHALL use SPARQL queries for domain-specific biological plausibility checks
3. WHEN monitoring quality THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on conversion success, enrichment accuracy, and validation pass rates
4. WHEN detecting issues THEN the system SHALL provide tools for consistency checking, gap identification, and automated improvement suggestions
5. WHEN scaling operations THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets efficiently with appropriate caching and indexing

### Requirement 5: Agent Integration and Clean APIs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean MCP server integration so that semantic capabilities are seamlessly available to conversion workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called by agents THEN the system SHALL provide MCP tools for knowledge graph generation, metadata enrichment, and validation
2. WHEN integrating with pipelines THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access and provide structured responses compatible with agent workflows
3. WHEN exposing functionality THEN the system SHALL provide SPARQL endpoints and export services for programmatic access
4. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL create human-readable summaries, interactive visualizations, and multiple export formats
5. WHEN integrating with DataLad THEN the system SHALL correlate semantic provenance with file-level provenance for complete audit trails

### Requirement 6: Advanced Knowledge Management Capabilities

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want advanced knowledge graph capabilities including ontology integration and federated queries so that I can leverage semantic web technologies for neuroscience research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating domain knowledge THEN the system SHALL incorporate established neuroscience ontologies (NIFSTD, UBERON) aligned to NWB-LinkML classes
2. WHEN reasoning about data THEN the system SHALL use domain-specific reasoning rules for neuroscience concepts and biological plausibility
3. WHEN querying across sources THEN the system SHALL support federated SPARQL queries across multiple knowledge sources with result aggregation
4. WHEN exploring knowledge THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations and faceted browsing with schema-aware navigation
5. WHEN managing evolution THEN the system SHALL support knowledge graph versioning, change tracking, and schema migration
