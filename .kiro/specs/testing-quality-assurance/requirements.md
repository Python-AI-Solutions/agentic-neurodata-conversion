# Testing and Quality Assurance Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on comprehensive testing strategies and quality assurance for the agentic neurodata conversion project. The testing approach must cover the MCP server, individual agents, client libraries, and end-to-end conversion workflows, while leveraging DataLad-managed test datasets for consistent and reproducible testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure for the MCP server, so that I can ensure the central orchestration hub works reliably under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing MCP server endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for each HTTP endpoint with various input scenarios
2. WHEN testing agent coordination THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests that verify proper agent orchestration and error handling
3. WHEN testing API contracts THEN the system SHALL validate that all endpoints conform to OpenAPI specifications and return consistent response formats
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL verify that the MCP server handles agent failures, timeouts, and malformed requests gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thorough testing of individual agents, so that I can ensure each agent performs its specialized tasks correctly and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing agent logic THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for each agent's core functionality in isolation
2. WHEN testing agent interfaces THEN the system SHALL verify that agents conform to expected input/output contracts
3. WHEN testing with mock data THEN the system SHALL support testing agents without requiring external LLM services or large datasets
4. WHEN testing agent error handling THEN the system SHALL verify that agents handle malformed inputs, service failures, and edge cases appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end testing with real datasets, so that I can validate the complete conversion pipeline works correctly with actual neuroscience data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN the system SHALL use DataLad-managed test datasets to ensure consistent and reproducible testing
2. WHEN testing different data formats THEN the system SHALL include test datasets representing major neuroscience data formats (Open Ephys, SpikeGLX, etc.)
3. WHEN validating conversion quality THEN the system SHALL verify that test conversions produce valid NWB files that pass validation
4. WHEN testing the complete pipeline THEN the system SHALL verify the full workflow from dataset analysis through final evaluation and knowledge graph generation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing of client libraries and integrations, so that I can ensure external interfaces work correctly and handle various usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing client libraries THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for client logic and HTTP communication handling
2. WHEN testing against mock servers THEN the system SHALL support testing client libraries without requiring a running MCP server
3. WHEN testing integration scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify that clients handle server errors, network issues, and partial failures correctly
4. WHEN testing different usage patterns THEN the system SHALL validate that clients work correctly in various environments (notebooks, scripts, workflows)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated testing and continuous integration, so that code quality is maintained and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run automated tests including unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent merging of failing code
3. WHEN running CI/CD THEN the system SHALL include testing with multiple Python versions and dependency configurations
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage reports and quality metrics for all components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing, so that I can ensure the system performs well under realistic usage conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL measure conversion times for datasets of various sizes and complexities
2. WHEN testing scalability THEN the system SHALL verify that the MCP server can handle multiple concurrent conversion requests
3. WHEN testing resource usage THEN the system SHALL monitor memory usage, CPU utilization, and disk I/O during conversions
4. WHEN testing limits THEN the system SHALL identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints under load

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want evaluation and validation testing, so that I can trust that conversions produce high-quality, standards-compliant NWB files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing conversion quality THEN the system SHALL validate that all test conversions produce NWB files that pass NWB Inspector validation
2. WHEN testing metadata completeness THEN the system SHALL verify that converted files contain expected metadata fields with appropriate values
3. WHEN testing knowledge graph generation THEN the system SHALL validate that generated RDF graphs are syntactically correct and semantically meaningful
4. WHEN testing evaluation reports THEN the system SHALL verify that quality reports accurately reflect the state of converted files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing utilities and fixtures, so that I can easily create and maintain tests for different components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating tests THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for setting up test environments, mock services, and test data
2. WHEN testing with datasets THEN the system SHALL provide fixtures for common test scenarios and data formats
3. WHEN testing agents THEN the system SHALL provide mock LLM services and deterministic test modes for consistent testing
4. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for inspecting test state, logging, and error conditions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want monitoring and observability testing, so that I can ensure the system provides adequate visibility into its operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing logging THEN the system SHALL verify that all components produce appropriate log messages at different severity levels
2. WHEN testing metrics THEN the system SHALL validate that performance metrics are collected and reported correctly
3. WHEN testing error tracking THEN the system SHALL verify that errors are properly captured, categorized, and reported
4. WHEN testing diagnostics THEN the system SHALL ensure that diagnostic endpoints and utilities provide useful information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want regression testing and compatibility testing, so that I can ensure changes don't break existing functionality and the system works across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL run regression tests to ensure existing functionality continues to work
2. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with different versions of key dependencies (NeuroConv, NWB, etc.)
3. WHEN testing environments THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across different operating systems and Python versions
4. WHEN testing backwards compatibility THEN the system SHALL ensure that API changes don't break existing client code without proper deprecation
