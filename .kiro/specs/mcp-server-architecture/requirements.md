# MCP Server Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that serves as the
central orchestration hub for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The MCP
server coordinates specialized agents through the MCP protocol and manages the
complete conversion workflow from dataset analysis to NWB file generation and
evaluation. Interface adapters (such as HTTP or stdin/stdout) provide optional
access methods for different integration needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a reliable MCP server that orchestrates
multi-agent data conversion workflows, so that I can convert neuroscience data
to NWB format through coordinated agent interactions regardless of the transport
protocol used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting data THEN the core service layer SHALL orchestrate
   conversation, conversion, and evaluation agents in coordinated workflows with
   error handling, independent of transport protocol
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the server SHALL handle dataset analysis,
   conversion script generation, and NWB evaluation through a core service layer
   that contains all business logic without transport dependencies
3. WHEN managing state THEN the core service SHALL coordinate multi-step
   workflows and maintain conversion context across agent interactions,
   accessible through any transport adapter
4. WHEN providing responses THEN the core service SHALL return structured
   results with complete metadata and error handling, formatted appropriately by
   transport-specific adapters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want MCP server capabilities that
expose the conversion pipeline programmatically through multiple transport
protocols, so that external tools and workflows can access the conversion
functionality using their preferred integration method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems connect THEN the MCP server SHALL expose conversion
   tools through a transport-agnostic core service layer with thin adapter
   layers for different protocols
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the MCP server SHALL provide structured responses
   with proper error handling through both MCP and HTTP adapters that call
   identical core service methods
3. WHEN managing sessions THEN the MCP server SHALL maintain conversion state
   and configuration in the core service layer, accessible through any transport
   adapter
4. WHEN providing interfaces THEN the MCP server SHALL support MCP protocol
   (stdin/stdout, local socket) and HTTP/WebSocket interfaces through separate
   adapter layers that ensure functional parity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to coordinate agent
interactions efficiently, so that the conversion pipeline operates reliably and
makes appropriate decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling agents THEN the MCP server SHALL invoke agents with proper error
   handling and timeout management
2. WHEN agents fail THEN the MCP server SHALL provide meaningful error messages
   and recovery suggestions
3. WHEN coordinating workflows THEN the MCP server SHALL manage dependencies
   between pipeline steps (analysis → conversion → evaluation)
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the MCP server SHALL provide status endpoints for
   monitoring conversion progress

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the MCP server to handle different data
formats automatically, so that I can convert various neuroscience data types
without manual format specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing datasets THEN the MCP server SHALL automatically detect
   formats (Open Ephys, SpikeGLX, etc.) and select appropriate NeuroConv
   interfaces
2. WHEN format detection fails THEN the MCP server SHALL provide clear error
   messages and suggest manual format specification
3. WHEN handling multiple formats THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate agents to
   handle complex multi-format datasets
4. WHEN validating inputs THEN the MCP server SHALL validate dataset structure
   before invoking conversion agents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want the MCP server to coordinate
validation and quality assessment systems, so that converted files meet
community requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NWB files are generated THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate with
   validation systems through appropriate agents and tools
2. WHEN validation is needed THEN the MCP server SHALL provide endpoints for
   triggering validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph generation
3. WHEN integrating systems THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate between agents
   and specialized validation/evaluation/knowledge graph systems
4. WHEN providing results THEN the MCP server SHALL aggregate results from
   validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph systems into cohesive responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to provide
monitoring and observability, so that I can track system performance and
identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running conversions THEN the MCP server SHALL provide comprehensive
   logging and metrics
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the MCP server SHALL include error tracking and
   diagnostic capabilities
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the MCP server SHALL track conversion
   success rates and processing times
4. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the MCP server SHALL provide analytics on
   conversion patterns and agent interactions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to support configuration
and customization, so that it can be adapted to different environments and use
cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the server THEN the MCP server SHALL support
   environment-based configuration for development and production
2. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the MCP server SHALL allow configuration of
   agent parameters, timeouts, and retry policies
3. WHEN deploying THEN the MCP server SHALL support containerization and
   different deployment configurations
4. WHEN integrating THEN the MCP server SHALL provide configuration options for
   different LLM providers and external services

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow clean
architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, so that the system
is maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the server THEN the system SHALL separate business logic
   into a transport-agnostic core service layer with no MCP or HTTP dependencies
2. WHEN adding transport protocols THEN the system SHALL implement thin adapter
   layers that map protocol-specific methods to core service functions
3. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL provide contract tests that
   verify both MCP and HTTP adapters call identical core service methods and
   produce equivalent results
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure new features are
   implemented in the core service layer and automatically available through all
   transport adapters
