# MCP Server Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that serves as the central orchestration hub for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The MCP server coordinates specialized agents through the MCP protocol and manages the complete conversion workflow from dataset analysis to NWB file generation and evaluation. The architecture must support multiple transport protocols (stdin/stdout, HTTP, WebSocket) through a clean separation of concerns, with a transport-agnostic core service layer containing all business logic and thin adapter layers for protocol-specific communication. The system must handle complex multi-agent workflows, maintain state across long-running operations, provide comprehensive observability, and scale to meet the demands of large-scale neuroscience data conversion projects.
