# MCP Server Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that serves as the central orchestration hub for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The MCP server coordinates specialized agents through HTTP endpoints and manages the complete conversion workflow from dataset analysis to NWB file generation and evaluation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a reliable MCP server that orchestrates multi-agent data conversion workflows, so that I can convert neuroscience data to NWB format through coordinated agent interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting data THEN the MCP server SHALL orchestrate conversation, conversion, and evaluation agents in coordinated workflows with error handling
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the MCP server SHALL handle dataset analysis, conversion script generation, and NWB evaluation as discrete HTTP endpoints
3. WHEN managing state THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate multi-step workflows and maintain conversion context across agent interactions
4. WHEN providing responses THEN the MCP server SHALL return structured results with complete metadata and error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want MCP server capabilities that expose the conversion pipeline programmatically, so that external tools and workflows can access the conversion functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems connect THEN the MCP server SHALL expose conversion tools through standardized FastAPI endpoints
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the MCP server SHALL provide RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes and error responses
3. WHEN managing sessions THEN the MCP server SHALL maintain conversion state and configuration across multiple API calls
4. WHEN providing documentation THEN the MCP server SHALL expose OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to coordinate agent interactions efficiently, so that the conversion pipeline operates reliably and makes appropriate decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling agents THEN the MCP server SHALL invoke agents with proper error handling and timeout management
2. WHEN agents fail THEN the MCP server SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery suggestions
3. WHEN coordinating workflows THEN the MCP server SHALL manage dependencies between pipeline steps (analysis → conversion → evaluation)
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the MCP server SHALL provide status endpoints for monitoring conversion progress

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the MCP server to handle different data formats automatically, so that I can convert various neuroscience data types without manual format specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing datasets THEN the MCP server SHALL automatically detect formats (Open Ephys, SpikeGLX, etc.) and select appropriate NeuroConv interfaces
2. WHEN format detection fails THEN the MCP server SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest manual format specification
3. WHEN handling multiple formats THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate agents to handle complex multi-format datasets
4. WHEN validating inputs THEN the MCP server SHALL validate dataset structure before invoking conversion agents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want the MCP server to coordinate validation and quality assessment systems, so that converted files meet community requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NWB files are generated THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate with validation systems through appropriate agents and tools
2. WHEN validation is needed THEN the MCP server SHALL provide endpoints for triggering validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph generation
3. WHEN integrating systems THEN the MCP server SHALL coordinate between agents and specialized validation/evaluation/knowledge graph systems
4. WHEN providing results THEN the MCP server SHALL aggregate results from validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph systems into cohesive responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to provide monitoring and observability, so that I can track system performance and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running conversions THEN the MCP server SHALL provide comprehensive logging and metrics
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the MCP server SHALL include error tracking and diagnostic capabilities
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the MCP server SHALL track conversion success rates and processing times
4. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the MCP server SHALL provide analytics on conversion patterns and agent interactions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to support configuration and customization, so that it can be adapted to different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the server THEN the MCP server SHALL support environment-based configuration for development and production
2. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the MCP server SHALL allow configuration of agent parameters, timeouts, and retry policies
3. WHEN deploying THEN the MCP server SHALL support containerization and different deployment configurations
4. WHEN integrating THEN the MCP server SHALL provide configuration options for different LLM providers and external services
