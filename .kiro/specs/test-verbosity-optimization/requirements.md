# Testing and Quality Assurance Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive testing strategies and quality assurance for the agentic neurodata conversion project. The testing approach must cover the MCP server, individual agents, client libraries, and end-to-end conversion workflows, while leveraging DataLad-managed test datasets for consistent and reproducible testing. The quality assurance framework must ensure reliability across all components, validate scientific correctness of conversions, maintain performance standards, and support continuous improvement through automated testing, monitoring, and feedback loops. The system must balance thorough testing with practical constraints of development velocity and resource availability.
