# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The test suite default configuration show not be too verbose. When executed by
agents it consumes tokens excessively. It can also make test output difficult to
parse. This requirement will optimize the default test verbosity to be minimal
while preserving the ability to use verbose output for targeted debugging and
development scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an automated agent, I want minimal test output by default, so
that I can efficiently process test results without consuming excessive tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running default test commands THEN the system SHALL produce minimal
   output showing only test results summary
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL show only a brief success summary with
   counts
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL show only the essential failure
   information without verbose tracebacks
4. WHEN running tests via pixi tasks THEN the default verbosity SHALL be minimal

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily access verbose test output when
debugging, so that I can get detailed information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using explicit verbose flags THEN the system SHALL provide detailed test
   output
2. WHEN debugging specific tests THEN the system SHALL support verbose
   tracebacks and detailed information
3. WHEN running targeted test commands THEN the system SHALL allow full
   verbosity control
4. WHEN using debug-specific commands THEN the system SHALL default to verbose
   output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CI/CD system, I want consistent and parseable test output,
so that I can reliably process test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable result
   summaries
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL include essential error information
   in a consistent format
3. WHEN running in automated environments THEN the system SHALL minimize noise
   while preserving critical information
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with
   existing tooling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want backward compatibility for
existing workflows, so that current development practices are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers use existing verbose commands THEN the system SHALL continue
   to work as expected
2. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN the system SHALL maintain existing
   functionality
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL preserve current
   reporting capabilities
4. WHEN debugging workflows are used THEN the system SHALL maintain full
   diagnostic capabilities
