# Agent Implementations Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on the specialized agents that are orchestrated by the MCP server to perform specific aspects of neuroscience data conversion. Each agent has a distinct responsibility: conversation agents analyze datasets and extract metadata, conversion agents generate and execute NeuroConv scripts, evaluation agents validate NWB outputs, and metadata questioners handle dynamic user interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a neuroscience researcher, I want a conversation agent that understands my domain and the target specification and can analyze my raw dataset and extract metadata. It shouldn't ask repeated questions and should only ask questions that cannot be easily inferred from the data or domain knowledge. This allows me to provide missing information through natural language interaction in as little time as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a raw dataset directory THEN the conversation agent SHALL analyze contents and identify data formats, experimental context, and missing metadata fields
2. WHEN essential metadata is missing THEN the conversation agent SHALL generate natural language questions understandable to non-expert users while including necessary details.
3. WHEN I respond to questions THEN the conversation agent SHALL validate responses against domain knowledge and suggest corrections for inconsistencies
4. WHEN metadata extraction is complete THEN the conversation agent SHALL provide structured summaries with clear provenance marking (user-provided vs. auto-detected)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a conversion agent that can automatically generate and execute NeuroConv scripts, so that my data is converted to NWB format without requiring deep technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provided with normalized metadata and file mappings THEN the conversion agent SHALL select appropriate NeuroConv DataInterface classes based on detected formats
2. WHEN generating conversion scripts THEN the conversion agent SHALL create valid Python code handling specific data formats and experimental setups
3. WHEN executing conversions THEN the conversion agent SHALL populate NWB metadata fields and mark which are auto-generated vs. user-provided
4. WHEN conversion fails THEN the conversion agent SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest corrective actions
5. WHEN conversion succeeds THEN the conversion agent SHALL record complete provenance information for the conversion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want an evaluation agent that coordinates validation and evaluation processes, so that converted files are properly assessed for quality and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an NWB file is generated THEN the evaluation agent SHALL coordinate with validation systems to assess file quality and compliance
2. WHEN validation is complete THEN the evaluation agent SHALL coordinate with evaluation systems to generate comprehensive reports and visualizations
3. WHEN knowledge graphs are needed THEN the evaluation agent SHALL coordinate with knowledge graph systems to generate semantic representations
4. WHEN providing results THEN the evaluation agent SHALL integrate results from validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph systems into cohesive outputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a metadata questioner that can dynamically generate questions based on missing information, so that I can provide domain-specific metadata through guided interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata gaps are identified THEN the metadata questioner SHALL generate contextually appropriate questions based on experimental type and data format
2. WHEN asking questions THEN the metadata questioner SHALL provide clear explanations of why information is needed and how it will be used
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN the metadata questioner SHALL validate answers against domain constraints and suggest alternatives for invalid responses
4. WHEN questions are complete THEN the metadata questioner SHALL integrate responses into the structured metadata with proper provenance tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all agents to follow consistent interfaces and patterns, so that they can be easily integrated, tested, and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing agents THEN all agents SHALL follow consistent error handling patterns and return structured responses
2. WHEN agents are called THEN they SHALL provide clear logging and progress indicators for long-running operations
3. WHEN agents fail THEN they SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested remediation steps
4. WHEN agents succeed THEN they SHALL return results in consistent formats that can be easily processed by the MCP server

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want agents to be configurable and monitorable, so that I can optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agents THEN each agent SHALL support configuration of LLM providers, model parameters, and operational settings
2. WHEN monitoring agents THEN each agent SHALL provide metrics on processing time, success rates, and resource usage
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN each agent SHALL provide detailed logging of internal operations and decision-making processes
4. WHEN agents interact with external services THEN they SHALL handle timeouts, retries, and service failures gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want agents to maintain provenance and transparency, so that I can understand and validate all automated decisions in my data conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents make decisions THEN they SHALL record the reasoning and data sources used for each decision
2. WHEN agents modify metadata THEN they SHALL clearly mark which fields were auto-generated vs. user-provided vs. externally enriched
3. WHEN agents use external knowledge THEN they SHALL provide citations and/or confidence scores for all external information
4. WHEN agents infer metadata from repeated patterns in the data THEN they shall provide an explanation of what heuristic or logic was used to make the inference.
5. WHEN agents complete processing THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive audit trails of all operations and transformations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to support testing and validation, so that I can ensure they work correctly with different data types and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing agents THEN each agent SHALL support mock modes that don't require external LLM services
2. WHEN validating agent behavior THEN each agent SHALL provide deterministic test modes for consistent testing
3. WHEN testing with different data THEN agents SHALL handle edge cases and malformed inputs gracefully
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN agents SHALL work correctly when called by the MCP server in realistic scenarios
