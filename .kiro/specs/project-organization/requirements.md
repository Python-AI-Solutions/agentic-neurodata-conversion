# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is an agentic tool for converting neuroscience data to standardized formats (initially NWB), leveraging LLMs and agentic workflows. The codebase has grown organically with significant functionality already developed, but now requires proper project organization, development patterns, testing infrastructure, documentation, and collaborative workflows to support AI-assisted development and team collaboration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical modules (etl for some one off or continuous data creation and a package with dependencies managed in pyproject.toml using pixi containing core, agents, interfaces, utils etc.)
2. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between data processing, agent logic, and infrastructure code
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have designated directories for different types of components
4. WHEN working with configuration THEN the system SHALL centralize configuration management in a dedicated location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent development patterns and best practices, so that the codebase maintains quality and consistency across all modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent coding standards through automated tools (ruff SHALL be used)

2. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL validate code quality through pre-commit hooks
3. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for error handling, logging, and configuration
4. WHEN creating new modules THEN the system SHALL provide templates and examples for common patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests for all core functionality
2. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests for agent workflows
3. WHEN evaluating conversions THEN the system SHALL include evaluation tests for data conversion accuracy
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage reporting and quality metrics
5. WHEN considering testing THEN the system SHALL make use of datalad to keep track of datasets used and consider the ones suggested in documents/possible-datasets. 

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thorough documentation, so that I can understand the system architecture and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the project THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation for all modules
2. WHEN learning the system THEN the system SHALL include architectural decision records and design documentation
3. WHEN using agents (note not the one used for the project itself) THEN the system SHALL document agent capabilities, interfaces, and usage patterns
4. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide clear contribution guidelines and development setup instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust development tooling, so that I can work efficiently with AI assistance and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing with AI THEN the system SHALL provide clear interfaces and documentation for AI-assisted workflows
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use modern package management with pixi with clear dependency specifications
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include containerization and deployment configurations.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want reliable data conversion workflows, so that I can convert neuroscience data to NWB format with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting data THEN the system SHALL provide validated conversion pipelines with error handling
2. WHEN processing different formats THEN the system SHALL support extensible data interface patterns
3. WHEN validating outputs THEN the system SHALL integrate NWB validation and quality checks
4. WHEN tracking provenance THEN the system SHALL maintain data lineage and conversion metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team member, I want collaborative development workflows, so that multiple developers can contribute effectively to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL provide clear branching and merge strategies
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL include automated CI/CD pipelines for quality assurance
3. WHEN managing releases THEN the system SHALL provide versioning and release management processes
4. WHEN onboarding THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive setup and contribution documentation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want monitoring and observability, so that I can track system performance and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running conversions THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and metrics
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL include error tracking and diagnostic capabilities
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track conversion success rates and processing times
4. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on conversion patterns and agent interactions
