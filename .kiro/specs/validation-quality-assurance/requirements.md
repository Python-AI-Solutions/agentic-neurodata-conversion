# Validation and Quality Assurance Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive, modular validation and quality assurance system for NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file conversions. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, enhanced traceability, and granular modularity to facilitate development, testing, debugging, and maintenance.

## Modular Architecture Overview

The validation system is divided into 8 core modules:

1. **Core Validation Framework** - Base validation infrastructure
2. **NWB Inspector Integration** - NWB-specific validation engine
3. **LinkML Schema Validation** - Metadata schema validation
4. **Quality Assessment Engine** - Multi-dimensional quality analysis
5. **Domain Knowledge Validator** - Neuroscience-specific validation
6. **Validation Orchestrator** - Coordination and workflow management
7. **Reporting and Analytics** - Result processing and visualization
8. **MCP Integration Layer** - API and service integration
