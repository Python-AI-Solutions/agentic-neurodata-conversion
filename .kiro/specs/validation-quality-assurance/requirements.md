# Validation and Quality Assurance Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on validation and quality assurance systems that ensure
converted NWB files meet community standards and best practices. This includes
NWB Inspector validation, LinkML schema validation, metadata completeness
checking, and comprehensive quality assessment frameworks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want comprehensive NWB validation
that checks schema compliance and best practices, so that converted files meet
community requirements before archival or sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an NWB file is generated THEN the validation system SHALL run NWB
   Inspector validation to check schema compliance and best practices
2. WHEN validation issues are found THEN the validation system SHALL categorize
   errors by severity (critical, warning, info) and provide specific remediation
   guidance
3. WHEN checking compliance THEN the validation system SHALL verify adherence to
   NWB standards, FAIR principles, and community best practices
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the validation system SHALL generate actionable
   reports with clear explanations of issues and how to fix them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LinkML schema validation that ensures
metadata follows structured formats, so that all conversions comply with
machine-readable specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing metadata THEN LinkML schemas SHALL validate all fields
   against machine-readable specifications before ingestion
2. WHEN generating validation classes THEN LinkML SHALL produce Pydantic/JSON
   Schema classes for runtime validation
3. WHEN enforcing standards THEN LinkML schemas SHALL ensure consistency with
   NWB metadata requirements and controlled vocabularies
4. WHEN detecting violations THEN LinkML validation SHALL provide specific error
   messages indicating which fields violate which constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive quality assessment that
evaluates multiple dimensions of data quality, so that I can understand the
completeness and reliability of my converted data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing quality THEN the validation system SHALL evaluate metadata
   completeness, data integrity, and structural compliance
2. WHEN checking metadata THEN the validation system SHALL identify missing
   required fields, incomplete optional fields, and inconsistent values
3. WHEN validating data integrity THEN the validation system SHALL check for
   data corruption, format consistency, and temporal alignment
4. WHEN providing assessments THEN the validation system SHALL generate quality
   scores and detailed quality reports with improvement recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want validation systems that integrate
seamlessly with the conversion pipeline, so that quality assurance is automatic
and doesn't disrupt workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with MCP server THEN the validation system SHALL provide
   validation tools accessible through standard MCP endpoints
2. WHEN called by agents THEN the validation system SHALL provide clean APIs
   that return structured validation results
3. WHEN processing files THEN the validation system SHALL handle various file
   sizes and formats efficiently without blocking other operations
4. WHEN reporting results THEN the validation system SHALL provide results in
   formats compatible with agents, MCP server, and client libraries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want validation rules that incorporate
neuroscience domain knowledge, so that validation goes beyond syntax checking to
include scientific validity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating experimental metadata THEN the validation system SHALL check
   scientific plausibility of experimental parameters
2. WHEN checking relationships THEN the validation system SHALL validate
   biological and experimental relationships for consistency
3. WHEN assessing completeness THEN the validation system SHALL identify
   domain-specific metadata that should be present for different experiment
   types
4. WHEN providing guidance THEN the validation system SHALL offer
   domain-specific recommendations for improving data quality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable validation frameworks, so
that validation rules can be customized for different use cases and evolving
standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring validation THEN the validation system SHALL support custom
   validation rules and quality metrics
2. WHEN updating standards THEN the validation system SHALL allow easy updates
   to validation schemas and rules
3. WHEN customizing checks THEN the validation system SHALL support lab-specific
   or project-specific validation requirements
4. WHEN managing complexity THEN the validation system SHALL provide validation
   profiles for different use cases (basic, comprehensive, domain-specific)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want validation systems that
provide detailed reporting and analytics, so that I can track quality trends and
identify common issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the validation system SHALL create comprehensive
   quality reports with detailed findings and recommendations
2. WHEN tracking trends THEN the validation system SHALL provide analytics on
   common validation issues and quality improvements over time
3. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the validation system SHALL highlight
   recurring issues and suggest systematic improvements
4. WHEN providing metrics THEN the validation system SHALL generate quality
   metrics suitable for monitoring and continuous improvement

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want validation systems that support
iterative improvement, so that I can progressively improve data quality through
multiple validation cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN iterating on quality THEN the validation system SHALL support
   re-validation after corrections with clear progress tracking
2. WHEN providing feedback THEN the validation system SHALL prioritize issues by
   impact and provide guidance on which to address first
3. WHEN tracking improvements THEN the validation system SHALL show quality
   improvements over multiple validation cycles
4. WHEN supporting workflows THEN the validation system SHALL integrate with
   human-in-the-loop refinement processes for expert review and correction
