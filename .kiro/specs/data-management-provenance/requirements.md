# Data Management and Provenance Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on data management, provenance tracking, and data lifecycle
management for the agentic neurodata conversion project. The system uses DataLad
for both development data management (test datasets, evaluation data) and user
conversion output provenance tracking, ensuring complete transparency and
reproducibility of all conversion processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want DataLad-managed development datasets, so
that I can test conversions with consistent, versioned data and track evaluation
results. I only download the parts of a dataset I want to use for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL use DataLad to manage test
   datasets, evaluation data, and conversion examples
2. WHEN adding test data THEN the system SHALL properly configure DataLad
   annexing to keep development files in git and only annex large data files
3. WHEN using evaluation datasets THEN the system SHALL make use of datasets
   suggested in documents/possible-datasets with proper DataLad subdataset
   management
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure test datasets are available
   and properly versioned through DataLad

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive provenance tracking for my
conversions, so that I can understand the origin and confidence level of every
piece of metadata in my final NWB file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any metadata field is populated THEN the system SHALL record the
   confidence level (definitive, high_evidence, human_confirmed, human_override,
   medium_evidence, heuristic, low_evidence, placeholder, unknown), source type,
   derivation method, and complete reasoning chain
2. WHEN tracking changes THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trails of
   all modifications, decisions, data transformations, and evidence conflicts
   with resolution methods
3. WHEN providing transparency THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between
   evidence-based decisions and human overrides, presenting evidence summaries
   for human review when conflicts exist
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include detailed provenance
   summaries with decision chains, evidence quality assessment, and confidence
   distributions allowing users to verify and validate all automated decisions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want each conversion to create its own
DataLad repository, so that I have complete version control and history of the
conversion process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a conversion THEN the system SHALL create a new DataLad
   repository for tracking the conversion outputs and history
2. WHEN conversion iterations occur THEN the system SHALL save each iteration
   with descriptive commit messages and proper versioning
3. WHEN conversions complete THEN the system SHALL tag successful conversions
   and summarize the conversion history.
4. WHEN accessing conversion outputs THEN the system SHALL provide easy access
   to all conversion artifacts, scripts, and evaluation results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want conversion outputs organized with
complete metadata and evaluation results, so that I can understand and validate
the conversion quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversions complete THEN the system SHALL organize outputs including
   NWB files, conversion scripts, validation reports, evaluation reports, and
   knowledge graph outputs
2. WHEN storing outputs THEN the system SHALL properly organize outputs from
   validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph systems
3. WHEN tracking provenance THEN the system SHALL record the complete pipeline
   including validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph generation steps
4. WHEN providing access THEN the system SHALL ensure all outputs from
   specialized systems are properly versioned and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper DataLad configuration and best
practices, so that the system handles data efficiently without common DataLad
pitfalls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring DataLad THEN the system SHALL use Python API exclusively
   (never CLI commands) for all DataLad operations
2. WHEN handling files THEN the system SHALL properly configure .gitattributes
   to keep development files in git and only annex large data files (>10MB)
3. WHEN managing subdatasets THEN the system SHALL handle conversion example
   repositories as subdatasets with proper installation and updates
4. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL handle common DataLad problems
   (missing subdatasets, locked files) gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want development data infrastructure that
supports collaborative development, so that all team members can access
consistent test data and evaluation datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup of
   DataLad infrastructure with proper directory structure
2. WHEN adding datasets THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for adding test
   datasets, evaluation data, and conversion examples
3. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL ensure all team members can access
   the same versioned datasets and evaluation data
4. WHEN updating data THEN the system SHALL provide clear processes for updating
   test datasets and evaluation benchmarks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want conversion provenance that integrates
with the MCP server workflow, so that all agent interactions and decisions are
properly tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the provenance system SHALL record all agent
   interactions, tool usage, and decision points
2. WHEN conversions progress THEN the provenance system SHALL track the complete
   pipeline from dataset analysis through final evaluation
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the provenance system SHALL record error conditions,
   recovery attempts, and final outcomes
4. WHEN conversions succeed THEN the provenance system SHALL provide complete
   audit trails that can be used for reproducibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization tools, so that the data management system operates efficiently under varying loads and dataset sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track conversion throughput, storage utilization, and query response times with configurable alerting thresholds and real-time dashboard visualization
2. WHEN optimizing storage THEN the system SHALL provide automated cleanup of temporary files, duplicate detection across repositories, and storage optimization recommendations with projected space savings
3. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies for frequently accessed datasets, provenance queries, and metadata lookups with configurable cache policies
4. WHEN scaling operations THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing across multiple DataLad repositories and automatic resource allocation based on demand
5. WHEN analyzing bottlenecks THEN the system SHALL provide performance analytics dashboards with conversion pipeline bottleneck identification, timing analysis, and optimization recommendations
6. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage through streaming processing, chunked operations, and intelligent data loading strategies
7. WHEN monitoring DataLad operations THEN the system SHALL track git-annex performance, repository health metrics, and subdataset synchronization efficiency with automated issue detection
