## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Baseline - 33% LLM Usage)

**User Experience**:
```
User: Upload file
System: Conversion failed

User: Why?
System: [no response - can't ask questions]

User: What do I need to fix?
System: Missing required fields
        - experimenter
        - institution
        - subject

User: What format was detected?
System: [no response - can't ask questions]
```

**Issues**:
- Rigid, template-based responses
- No explanations
- Can't answer questions
- Generic error messages
- Hardcoded field detection

---

### After (85% LLM Usage)

**User Experience**:
```
User: Upload file
System: I detected this as SpikeGLX data (85% confidence).
        Starting conversion...

        ‚ùå Conversion failed

        The file format couldn't be fully processed because
        the metadata file is corrupted or incomplete.

        Likely Cause: The .ap.meta file appears to have
        incorrect JSON formatting.

        What You Can Do:
        1. Re-export the data from SpikeGLX
        2. Check the .meta file opens in a text editor
        3. Verify the recording completed successfully

        This is recoverable by re-uploading clean files.

User: What is NWB format?
System: NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) is a standardized
        file format for neurophysiology data. It's designed to:
        - Enable data sharing across labs
        - Work with DANDI archive
        - Support various recording types

        Your SpikeGLX data will be converted to NWB for
        long-term storage and sharing.

        Would you like to proceed with the conversion?

User: Yes
System: Great! I noticed a few things about your recording:

        ‚úÖ Good news: The file structure is valid
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing metadata: I need some information from you

        **DANDI-Blocking (must fix to submit)**:
        - Subject ID: Unique identifier for the animal
          Example: "mouse001"

        **Best Practices (recommended)**:
        - Experimenter: Who conducted this recording?
          I detected this might be electrophysiology data
          Example: ["Jane Doe", "John Smith"]

        **Nice-to-Have**:
        - Keywords: Help others find your data
          Suggestions: "electrophysiology", "visual cortex"

        Can you provide the subject ID and experimenter info?
```

**Improvements**:
- Conversational and natural
- Explains WHY things failed
- Answers any question
- Contextual metadata requests
- Prioritizes what's important
- Proactive suggestions
