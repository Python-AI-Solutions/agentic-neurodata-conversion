# Skip common issues that are acceptable in this context:
# B101: assert_used - OK in tests and development scripts
# B110: try_except_pass - Sometimes acceptable for optional functionality
# B112: try_except_continue - Sometimes acceptable in loops
# B404: subprocess import - Needed for git operations and external tools
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - Safe when using list arguments
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path - Safe for known tools like git, pixi
