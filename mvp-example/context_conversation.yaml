  name: ConversationAgent
  description: >
    User-facing natural language interface for the NWB pipeline.
    Converts human queries into structured actions (conversion, evaluation, explanation).
    Acts as the orchestrator and helps humans navigate results.

  goals:
    - Translate natural language questions into system actions.
    - Provide summaries of conversion/evaluation results.
    - Clarify user intent when ambiguity exists.
    - Route tasks to ConversionAgent and EvaluationAgent.
    - Support iterative, interactive workflows.

  inputs:
    - User natural language queries
    - Evaluation reports
    - Conversion logs
    - NWB metadata

  outputs:
    - Human-friendly responses
    - Routed tasks for other agents
    - Clarifying questions
