## Usage Instructions

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Initial setup** (one-time):

   ```bash
   pixi install
   pixi run python scripts/setup_hooks.py
   ```

2. **Before making changes**:

   ```bash
   pixi run pre-commit  # Run all quality checks
   ```

3. **Fast development cycle**:

   ```bash
   pixi run pytest tests/unit/ --no-cov -x  # Quick tests
   ```

4. **Before committing**:
   ```bash
   pixi run pre-commit  # Ensure quality
   pixi run pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/  # Full test suite
   ```

### Quality Assurance Commands

```bash
# Full quality check
pixi run pre-commit

# Specific checks
pixi run ruff check .          # Linting
pixi run ruff format .         # Formatting
pixi run mypy agentic_neurodata_conversion/  # Type checking
pixi run bandit -r agentic_neurodata_conversion/  # Security

# Configuration validation
pixi run python scripts/validate_config.py
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Fast unit tests
pixi run pytest tests/unit/ --no-cov -x

# Integration tests
pixi run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# With coverage
pixi run pytest --cov=agentic_neurodata_conversion

# Performance tests
pixi run pytest -m "performance"
```

## Secrets Detection

The project includes comprehensive secrets detection to prevent accidental
commits of sensitive information:

### Current Status

- **Baseline file** created with known false positives
- **Pre-commit hook** available but commented out (requires detect-secrets
  installation)
- **Management script** for handling false positives
- **Documentation** for proper secrets management

### To Enable Full Secrets Detection

1. Install detect-secrets: `pip install detect-secrets` or
   `pixi add detect-secrets`
2. Uncomment the detect-secrets section in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
3. Run: `detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline`
4. Audit: `detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline`

See `docs/secrets-management.md` for detailed instructions.

## CI/CD Pipeline Behavior

- Security analysis
- Documentation validation
- Build verification

### On Main Branch Push

- Extended test suite
- Coverage reporting
- Artifact generation

### Nightly (Scheduled)

- Extended integration tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Customization and Extension

### Adding New Workflows

1. Create `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Follow existing patterns for pixi integration
3. Add appropriate triggers and jobs
4. Test with workflow dispatch

### Modifying Pre-commit Hooks

1. Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
2. Test locally: `pixi run pre-commit`
3. Consider developer workflow impact
4. Update documentation

### Adding New Issue Templates

1. Create YAML files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. Test in GitHub UI
3. Update configuration links
4. Consider user experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pre-commit failures**: Run `pixi run pre-commit` locally first
2. **Test failures**: Use `-v` for verbose output, `-x` to stop on first failure
3. **Pixi environment issues**: Ensure all commands use `pixi run`
4. **Configuration errors**: Run `pixi run python scripts/validate_config.py`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Validate workflows
pixi run python -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(".github/workflows/ci.yml"))'

# Check pre-commit config
pixi run pre-commit validate-config

# Test package building
pixi run python -m build

# Check pixi environment
pixi list
pixi info
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Weekly**: Review dependency update PRs
- **Monthly**: Audit secrets baseline
- **Quarterly**: Review and update CI/CD workflows
- **As needed**: Update issue templates and documentation

### Metrics to Monitor

- Test pass rates across Python versions
- Code coverage trends
- Security vulnerability counts
- Dependency freshness
- CI/CD pipeline performance

## Next Steps

The CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational and ready for collaborative
development. Key next steps:

1. **Team onboarding**: Share contributing guidelines with team members
2. **Secrets setup**: Enable full secrets detection if needed
3. **Monitoring setup**: Configure alerts for CI/CD failures
4. **Documentation**: Keep README and docs updated as project evolves
5. **Optimization**: Monitor CI/CD performance and optimize as needed

The pipeline provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality, security,
and reliability while supporting efficient collaborative development.
