## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer on the agentic neurodata conversion project, I need comprehensive testing infrastructure that validates the reliability, correctness, and performance of all system components‚Äîfrom individual agents to the complete conversion pipeline. The testing framework must provide confidence that conversions produce scientifically accurate, standards-compliant NWB files while maintaining development velocity through automated testing and rapid feedback loops.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new code change to the MCP server, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** unit tests execute within 5 minutes achieving 90%+ coverage, integration tests complete within 15 minutes covering 20+ workflow scenarios, and all security checks pass with zero OWASP violations

2. **Given** an agent implementation, **When** running the test suite, **Then** 50+ unit test cases validate core functionality, property-based tests verify data transformations, 100+ mock scenarios test external dependencies, and performance benchmarks detect any regressions

3. **Given** a DataLad-managed test dataset, **When** running end-to-end conversion tests, **Then** the pipeline processes data up to 1TB, produces NWB files passing NWB Inspector validation with zero critical issues, maintains <1ms temporal alignment, achieves >95% metadata completeness, and generates quality evaluation reports

4. **Given** a Python client library update, **When** running integration tests, **Then** the client works correctly across Python 3.8-3.12, handles 50+ error scenarios gracefully, maintains 85%+ code coverage, passes chaos engineering resilience tests, and meets defined performance budgets

5. **Given** a converted NWB file, **When** running validation tests, **Then** the file passes PyNWB schema compliance with zero violations, achieves >99% pass rate on quality scoring, generates valid RDF graphs with >80% ontology linking, produces evaluation reports in HTML/PDF/JSON formats, and meets FAIR/BIDS/DANDI compliance standards

6. **Given** test execution across environments, **When** the CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** tests execute in parallel across Python versions 3.8-3.12 and OS platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows), generate comprehensive coverage reports, identify flaky tests automatically, and reduce feedback time by 50% through optimization strategies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **MCP server receives malformed requests with invalid authentication, oversized payloads, or concurrent modification conflicts?** System must return specific error codes, handle gracefully without crashes, and log audit trails

- How does system handle **agent failures including timeouts, crashes, invalid responses, or resource exhaustion?** System must implement retry logic with exponential backoff, circuit breaker activation, graceful degradation, and proper error propagation

- What happens when **test datasets contain corrupted segments, missing metadata, or legacy format incompatibilities?** System must detect issues during format detection, provide clear error messages, support partial conversions, and maintain error recovery capabilities

- How does system validate **conversion quality for edge cases like numerical precision loss, unit conversion errors, temporal misalignment, or incomplete provenance chains?** System must use automated quality scoring, checksum verification, cross-reference validation, and domain expert criteria

- What happens when **client libraries encounter network failures, server maintenance windows, rate limiting, or connection pool exhaustion?** System must implement automatic retry with jitter, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, timeout handling, and resource cleanup

- How does system handle **parallel test execution conflicts, environment provisioning failures, flaky tests, or distributed test coordination?** System must provide test isolation, automatic environment cleanup, flaky test identification, retry mechanisms, and infrastructure-as-code management
