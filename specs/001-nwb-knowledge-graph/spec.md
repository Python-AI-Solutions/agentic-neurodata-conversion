## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a** neuroscience researcher
**I want to** analyze my NWB experimental data files for quality and completeness
**So that** I can ensure data integrity before publication and understand the structure and relationships within my data through interactive visualizations

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid NWB 2.x file from an electrophysiology experiment
   **When** the researcher submits the file for analysis
   **Then** the system provides a comprehensive evaluation report showing data quality, validation issues, and completeness scores in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, plain text)

2. **Given** an evaluated NWB file
   **When** the system generates the knowledge graph
   **Then** the researcher receives a semantic representation in standard formats (Turtle, JSON-LD) that accurately reflects all experimental entities and their relationships

3. **Given** a generated knowledge graph
   **When** the researcher opens the interactive visualization
   **Then** they can explore entities, relationships, and metadata through an offline-capable web interface with search, filtering, and multiple layout options

4. **Given** an NWB file with custom extensions
   **When** the system processes the file
   **Then** it handles the extensions gracefully, documents what couldn't be mapped, and continues processing without failure

5. **Given** a large NWB file (1GB)
   **When** the researcher submits it for processing
   **Then** the system completes all analysis, conversion, and visualization generation within 15 minutes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an NWB file is corrupted or invalid?
  - System validates file integrity immediately, provides clear error messages, and stops processing critical errors

- How does the system handle missing or incomplete metadata?
  - System notes missing fields as warnings, continues processing, includes diagnostics in the evaluation report

- What if custom extensions use non-standard naming?
  - System documents unrecognized extensions, maps to closest standard types, flags extensions in the report

- How does the system perform with files containing thousands of entities?
  - Visualization optimizes rendering for large graphs (level-of-detail, viewport culling), provides configurable node limits
