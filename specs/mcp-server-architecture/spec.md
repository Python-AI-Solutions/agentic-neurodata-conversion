## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As a neuroscience researcher**, I want a central orchestration system that
coordinates specialized AI agents to convert my raw experimental data into
standardized NWB format, so that I can share my data with the scientific
community and meet repository requirements without manual conversion scripting.

**As a system integrator**, I want to access the conversion pipeline through
multiple communication protocols (MCP, HTTP, WebSocket), so that I can integrate
the conversion capabilities into my existing data management workflows and
automation pipelines.

**As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability
of the conversion system, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks,
troubleshoot failures, and optimize resource utilization across the
infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Dataset Conversion

1. **Given** a researcher has raw neuroscience data in an unstructured format
2. **When** they submit the dataset path to the orchestration system
3. **Then** the system SHALL automatically detect the data format with
   confidence scoring
4. **And** coordinate the conversation agent to analyze the dataset structure
5. **And** invoke the metadata questioner agent to collect missing experimental
   metadata
6. **And** coordinate the conversion agent to generate NWB files
7. **And** invoke the evaluation agent to validate the output against NWB
   standards
8. **And** provide a comprehensive quality report with DANDI readiness scores

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Format Dataset Processing

1. **Given** a dataset contains multiple data formats (e.g., electrophysiology +
   imaging)
2. **When** the orchestration system processes the dataset
3. **Then** it SHALL detect all formats with format-specific confidence scores
4. **And** determine the optimal processing order based on dependencies
5. **And** coordinate parallel agent execution where formats are independent
6. **And** merge results into a unified NWB file with proper provenance tracking
7. **And** validate cross-format consistency and completeness

#### Scenario 3: Long-Running Conversion with Recovery

1. **Given** a conversion workflow is processing a 500GB dataset
2. **When** the system experiences a transient failure during processing
3. **Then** it SHALL persist the workflow state with checkpoint markers
4. **And** automatically retry failed steps with exponential backoff
5. **And** resume from the last successful checkpoint without reprocessing
   completed steps
6. **And** maintain complete provenance information including retry history
7. **And** notify administrators if maximum retry attempts are exceeded

#### Scenario 4: Multi-Protocol Access

1. **Given** an external automation system needs conversion capabilities
2. **When** it connects via HTTP REST API instead of MCP protocol

   functionality
4. **And** maintain conversion state across multiple HTTP requests using session
   tokens
5. **And** provide streaming progress updates via WebSocket connections
6. **And** generate equivalent audit logs and provenance records
7. **And** enforce the same quality gates and validation rules

#### Scenario 5: Validation Failure Handling

1. **Given** a conversion produces an NWB file that fails validation
2. **When** the evaluation agent reports validation errors
3. **Then** the orchestration system SHALL categorize errors by severity
4. **And** attempt automated fixes for common issues (e.g., missing required
   fields)
5. **And** provide detailed diagnostics with file locations and suggested
   remediation
6. **And** allow interactive repair workflows with user guidance
7. **And** re-validate after fixes and update quality scores

#### Scenario 6: Batch Processing with Resource Management

1. **Given** 100 datasets are queued for conversion
2. **When** the orchestration system processes the batch
3. **Then** it SHALL prioritize requests based on urgency and resource
   requirements
4. **And** manage resource pools to prevent agent overload
5. **And** implement fair scheduling across concurrent workflows
6. **And** apply backpressure when agents are overwhelmed
7. **And** provide progress tracking and ETA for each dataset

   questioner agent, conversion agent, and evaluation agent are available with
   defined interfaces
2. **NeuroConv Library**: Format detection and conversion capabilities depend on
   NeuroConv's interface catalog
3. **Validation Tools**: Integration requires nwbinspector, PyNWB, and DANDI CLI
   tools to be installed and accessible
4. **Storage Backend**: State persistence requires access to durable storage
   (filesystem, database, or object storage)
5. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Observability features require OpenTelemetry
   collector and metrics storage

### Assumptions

1. **Network Reliability**: Transport adapters assume reasonable network
   stability for protocol communication
2. **Resource Availability**: Workflow orchestration assumes sufficient compute
   resources (CPU, memory, disk) for concurrent operations
3. **Schema Stability**: NWB validation assumes schema versions remain backward
   compatible
4. **Agent Responsiveness**: Orchestration assumes agents respond within
   reasonable timeout periods (configurable)
5. **User Expertise**: Interactive metadata collection assumes users have domain
   knowledge to answer experimental questions

### Scope Boundaries

2. Development of new NeuroConv interfaces for unsupported formats
3. Creation of new validation rules (uses existing NWB Inspector, PyNWB, DANDI
   validators)
4. User interface development (specification focuses on service layer and APIs)
5. Data storage backend implementation (uses existing storage solutions)
6. Authentication and authorization mechanisms (assumes external identity
   management)
7. Deployment infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker configurations)
8. Cost optimization for cloud resources (monitoring provided, optimization is
   external)

   via retry and checkpoint mechanisms
3. **Uptime**: 99.5%+ availability for orchestration service
4. **Data Loss**: Zero data loss during workflow failures with checkpoint
   recovery

### Operational Metrics

1. **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: < 2 minutes for critical errors via
   monitoring
2. **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**: < 15 minutes for common failures via
   automated recovery
3. **Configuration Change Success Rate**: 98%+ of configuration updates applied
   without incidents
4. **Audit Trail Completeness**: 100% of workflows have complete provenance
   records
