## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a neuroscience researcher working with NWB data, I want a comprehensive
knowledge graph system that automatically enriches my metadata, validates data
quality, and enables complex semantic queries, so that I can focus on scientific
analysis while ensuring data integrity and discoverability.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** incomplete metadata with missing species information, **When** the
   researcher uploads NWB data, **Then** the system automatically suggests
   species mapping based on strain information with confidence scores and
   evidence chains
2. **Given** a data manager needs to validate experimental protocols, **When**
   they execute SPARQL queries against the knowledge graph, **Then** the system
   returns validation results with detailed reports and suggested corrections
3. **Given** a standards engineer updating NWB-LinkML schema, **When** schema
   changes are made, **Then** the system automatically regenerates JSON-LD
   contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF artifacts with complete version tracking
4. **Given** a domain expert exploring neuroscience concepts, **When** they
   query ontology relationships, **Then** the system provides semantic mappings
   between NWB classes and established ontologies (NIFSTD, UBERON, CHEBI,
   NCBITaxon)
5. **Given** an MCP server integration request, **When** agents query for
   metadata enrichment, **Then** the system provides structured responses
   compatible with agent interfaces while maintaining data consistency

### Edge Cases

- What happens when NWB data contains unknown structures not covered by the
  standard schema?
- How does the system handle conflicting enrichment suggestions from multiple
  knowledge sources?
- What occurs when SPARQL queries exceed performance thresholds or timeout
  limits?
- How does the system maintain consistency during concurrent access from
  multiple agents?
- What happens when schema validation fails due to malformed or incomplete data?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: What is the target query response time threshold for metadata enrichment
  operations that would trigger performance optimization or query rejection? ‚Üí
  A: Under 30 seconds (long-running analysis acceptable)
- Q: What confidence score threshold should trigger automatic acceptance vs.
  requiring human review for metadata enrichment suggestions? ‚Üí A: All
  suggestions require human review
- Q: What is the expected scale of concurrent users that the knowledge graph
  system should support? ‚Üí A: 1-10 concurrent users (small research lab)
- Q: What should happen when the system encounters conflicting metadata
  suggestions from different external knowledge sources? ‚Üí A: Present all
  conflicts to user for manual resolution
- Q: What is the expected maximum dataset size (number of NWB files) the
  knowledge graph should handle efficiently? ‚Üí A: Up to 100 NWB files (single
  experiment scale)
- Q: When schema validation fails for NWB data, what should be the system's
  default behavior? ‚Üí A: Reject data and require manual correction

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enrich metadata using external knowledge sources with
  strain-to-species mappings, device specifications, and experimental protocols
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide confidence levels and complete reasoning
  chains for all enrichment suggestions, requiring human review for all
  automated suggestions
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and handle conflicts between different
  knowledge sources with evidence quality assessment, presenting all conflicts
  to users for manual resolution
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain semantic relationships between entities using
  PROV-O ontology for complete provenance tracking
- **FR-005**: System MUST support SPARQL queries for complex metadata validation
  and enrichment rule implementation
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate SHACL shapes from NWB-LinkML schema for
  structural validation
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow definition of custom validation rules and
  enrichment patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide efficient query execution with appropriate
  indexing and optimization. Performance targets: <200ms for simple SPARQL
  queries (basic lookups), <30 seconds for complex metadata enrichment
  operations (per clarification session 2025-09-29)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate LinkML instances (YAML/JSON) against
  NWB-LinkML schema, rejecting invalid data and requiring manual correction
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate RDF using schema references to ensure
  consistent IRIs
- **FR-011**: System MUST run SHACL validation using generated shapes and
  produce detailed reports
- **FR-012**: System MUST produce knowledge graphs in JSON-LD with
  schema-derived context and TTL formats
- **FR-013**: System MUST expose knowledge graphs through standard SPARQL
  endpoints (Note: SPARQL queries are executed via MCP tools per
  constitutional MCP-centric requirement; internal SPARQL endpoint is accessed
  through MCP tool decorated functions, not direct HTTP endpoints)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide programmatic access to knowledge graph data
  through service layer interfaces exposed via MCP tools (no direct HTTP API
  endpoints per constitutional MCP-centric requirement)
- **FR-015**: System MUST integrate core neuroscience ontologies (NIFSTD,
  UBERON, CHEBI, NCBITaxon) with concept mapping
- **FR-016**: System MUST establish semantic relationships using OWL equivalence
  and subsumption with confidence scoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST expose functionality through MCP tools for agent
  integration
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle concurrent access and maintain data consistency
  for up to 10 simultaneous users. Consistency model: eventual consistency with
  conflict detection and manual resolution (per FR-003, all conflicts presented
  to user for resolution)
- **FR-019**: System MUST regenerate artifacts when NWB-LinkML schema updates
  and store version metadata
- **FR-020**: System MUST automatically discover entity types and properties
  through runtime schema analysis
