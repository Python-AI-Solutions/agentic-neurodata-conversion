3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ Constitution loaded and compliance evaluated
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ All constitutional principles aligned with knowledge graph requirements
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ Research completed for LinkML, RDF, SPARQL, and MCP integration
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → ✅ Design artifacts generated with semantic web compliance
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section

- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Comprehensive knowledge graph system for NWB data that
enriches metadata, validates quality, and enables semantic queries. Technical
approach uses LinkML schema-first development with W3C semantic web standards
(RDF, SPARQL, SHACL), integrated through MCP server architecture for
agent-driven workflows. Small research lab scale (1-10 users, 100 NWB files,
30-second query limits) with mandatory human review for all enrichment
suggestions.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (based on existing pixi.toml configuration)
**Primary Dependencies**: rdflib, linkml, pynwb, fastapi, mcp, SHACL validation
libraries **Storage**: RDF triple store with SPARQL endpoint, file-based
NWB-LinkML schema artifacts **Testing**: pytest with contract tests for SPARQL
endpoints, SHACL validation, MCP tools **Target Platform**: Linux/macOS
development environment with containerized deployment **Project Type**: single -
knowledge graph library with CLI and MCP server interfaces **Performance
Goals**: <200ms for simple SPARQL queries, <30 seconds for complex metadata
enrichment, optimized indexing for common patterns **Constraints**: Small
research lab scale (1-10 concurrent users), human review mandatory
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 100 NWB files per dataset, basic neuroscience ontology
integration

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Schema-First Development**: ✅ PASS - LinkML schema drives all data structures
and validation **Semantic Web Standards**: ✅ PASS - W3C RDF, OWL, SPARQL,
JSON-LD with PROV-O provenance **Test-First Development**: ✅ PASS - Contract
tests for SPARQL, SHACL, MCP before implementation **MCP Server Integration**:
✅ PASS - Clean separation of knowledge graph logic and MCP interfaces **Data
Quality Assurance**: ✅ PASS - Confidence scoring, lineage tracking, evidence
trails mandatory

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected for Python-based
semantic web library. Knowledge graph components organized by function (schema,
ontology, enrichment, validation, SPARQL, MCP) with clear separation between
core logic and external interfaces. Tests follow constitutional TDD requirements
with contract, integration, and unit test layers.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

✅ **Research completed** in `research.md` covering:

**LinkML Schema Integration**:

- Decision: Use NWB-LinkML as canonical schema source with automated artifact
  generation
- Rationale: Ensures consistency with NWB standards and enables W3C semantic web
  output
- Alternatives considered: Custom schema definition, manual RDF generation

**RDF Triple Store Selection**:

- Decision: rdflib with optional SPARQL endpoint backend for development,
  scalable triple store for production
- Rationale: Python ecosystem compatibility, development flexibility, production
  scalability path
- Alternatives considered: Native triple stores (Jena, Blazegraph), embedded
  solutions

**SHACL Validation Framework**:

- Decision: pyshacl library with LinkML-generated shapes for structural
  validation
- Rationale: Python integration, automatic shape generation from schema, W3C
  compliance
- Alternatives considered: Manual SHACL shape definition, alternative validation
  approaches

**MCP Server Architecture**:

- Decision: FastAPI-based MCP server with clean tool interface layer
- Rationale: Async support for concurrent users, clean separation of concerns,
  constitutional compliance
- Alternatives considered: Synchronous server, direct integration without MCP
  layer

**Neuroscience Ontology Integration**:

- Decision: Basic concept mapping with NIFSTD, UBERON, CHEBI, NCBITaxon through
  OWL imports
- Rationale: Semantic richness for neuroscience domain, confidence scoring for
  mappings
- Alternatives considered: Full ontology reasoning, manual concept definitions

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

✅ **Design artifacts generated**:

1. **Data model extraction** → `data-model.md`:
   - 11 core entities with semantic relationships and LinkML schema compliance
   - Validation rules from functional requirements with SHACL shape generation
   - State transitions for enrichment workflow and quality assurance processes

2. **API contracts generation** → `/contracts/`:
   - SPARQL endpoint OpenAPI specification with query validation
   - MCP tools specification for agent integration interfaces
   - Schema validation API with LinkML and SHACL compliance endpoints

3. **Contract tests preparation**:
   - Failing tests for SPARQL query execution and optimization
   - SHACL validation contract tests with shape generation verification
   - MCP tool integration tests with structured response validation

4. **Integration test scenarios** → `quickstart.md`:
   - End-to-end metadata enrichment workflow with human review
   - Schema validation and artifact regeneration procedures
   - Quality assurance and lineage tracking verification

5. **Agent context update** → `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Updated with semantic web technology stack and constitutional principles
   - Knowledge graph specific commands and development workflow guidance
   - Recent changes tracking for feature development history

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md,
CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during
/plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template for TDD workflow
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs prioritizing constitutional compliance
- SPARQL endpoint contracts → contract test tasks [P] with query optimization
- LinkML schema entities → model creation tasks [P] with validation rules
- MCP integration scenarios → tool implementation tasks with clean separation
- Enrichment workflow → integration test tasks with human review requirements

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Constitutional TDD order: Schema definition → Contract tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: LinkML schema → RDF generation → SPARQL → MCP tools
- Mark [P] for parallel execution on independent semantic components
- Ensure SHACL shape generation before validation implementation

**Estimated Output**: 80+ numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on
semantic web compliance with comprehensive LinkML model coverage and query
optimization

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md) **Phase 4**:
Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles) **Phase
5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations requiring justification_
