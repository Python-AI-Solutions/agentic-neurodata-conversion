# Feature Specification: Data Management and Provenance

**Feature Branch**: `data-management-provenance` **Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft **Input**: User description: "Data Management and Provenance -
DataLad-based data management with comprehensive provenance tracking for
neurodata conversions"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Development Dataset Management (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to work with consistent, versioned test datasets that I
can selectively download and use for testing conversions, ensuring
reproducibility across the development team.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all development and testing
activities. Without reliable test datasets, developers cannot validate
conversions or build new features effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up a test dataset,
selectively downloading specific files, running a conversion test, and verifying
that the dataset version is tracked and reproducible across different developer
environments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new development environment, **When** setting up test datasets,
   **Then** DataLad manages test data, evaluation data, and conversion examples
   with proper versioning
2. **Given** adding new test files, **When** committing to the repository,
   **Then** development files remain in git while large data files (>10MB) are
   annexed
3. **Given** a test dataset subdataset, **When** running tests, **Then** only
   the required portions of the dataset are downloaded on-demand
4. **Given** test execution, **When** tests access datasets, **Then** datasets
   are available, properly versioned, and consistent across environments

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Provenance Tracking (Priority: P1)

As a researcher, I need complete transparency into how every piece of metadata
in my NWB file was derived, including confidence levels, sources, and reasoning
chains, so I can validate and trust the automated conversion.

**Why this priority**: Provenance is critical for scientific reproducibility and
trust. Researchers must understand the basis for every automated decision to
validate results and meet publication standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a conversion, examining the
provenance records for any metadata field, and verifying that confidence levels,
source types, derivation methods, and complete reasoning chains are documented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a metadata field is populated, **When** examining provenance,
   **Then** the system records confidence level
   (definitive/high_evidence/human_confirmed/human_override/medium_evidence/heuristic/low_evidence/placeholder/unknown),
   source type, derivation method, and reasoning chain
2. **Given** multiple evidence sources conflict, **When** resolution occurs,
   **Then** the system maintains audit trails showing all evidence, the
   conflict, and the resolution method
3. **Given** evidence-based and human override decisions, **When** generating
   reports, **Then** the system clearly distinguishes between them and presents
   evidence summaries for human review
4. **Given** conversion completion, **When** generating provenance reports,
   **Then** reports include decision chains, evidence quality assessment, and
   confidence distributions for all automated decisions

### User Story 3 - Conversion Output Repository (Priority: P2)

As a data manager, I need each conversion to create its own versioned repository
that tracks all iterations, outputs, and history, so I can maintain complete
provenance and easily roll back or compare versions.

**Why this priority**: Essential for data management and reproducibility, but
can be implemented after basic provenance tracking is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a conversion, making
iterative improvements, and verifying that each iteration is committed with
descriptive messages, successful conversions are tagged, and all artifacts are
accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** starting a new conversion, **When** initialization occurs, **Then**
   a new DataLad repository is created for tracking outputs and history
2. **Given** conversion iterations, **When** each iteration completes, **Then**
   the system saves it with descriptive commit messages and proper versioning
3. **Given** successful conversion completion, **When** finalizing, **Then** the
   system tags the conversion and provides a summary of the conversion history
4. **Given** completed conversion, **When** accessing outputs, **Then** all
   artifacts including NWB files, scripts, and evaluation results are easily
   accessible

---

### User Story 4 - Organized Output Structure (Priority: P2)

As a researcher, I need conversion outputs organized with complete metadata,
validation reports, and evaluation results in a structured format, so I can
understand and validate conversion quality without hunting for files.

**Why this priority**: Important for usability and quality assurance, but
depends on conversions producing outputs first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a conversion and
verifying that outputs are organized into clear directories (NWB files, scripts,
validation reports, evaluation reports, knowledge graph outputs) with proper
versioning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** conversion completion, **When** organizing outputs, **Then** the
   system structures NWB files, conversion scripts, validation reports,
   evaluation reports, and knowledge graph outputs in designated locations
2. **Given** validation and evaluation systems run, **When** storing outputs,
   **Then** outputs from these specialized systems are properly organized and
   accessible
3. **Given** complete pipeline execution, **When** tracking provenance, **Then**
   validation, evaluation, and knowledge graph generation steps are recorded
4. **Given** organized outputs, **When** accessing files, **Then** all outputs
   from specialized systems are versioned and easily discoverable

---

### User Story 5 - Agent Integration Provenance (Priority: P3)

As a researcher, I need provenance tracking that captures all agent
interactions, tool usage, and decision points throughout the MCP server
workflow, so I can understand the complete automated process.

**Why this priority**: Enhances provenance detail but requires the basic
provenance and agent systems to be operational first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a conversion with agent
interactions, then examining provenance to verify that agent decisions, tool
calls, and reasoning are captured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agent decision-making, **When** agents interact with tools,
   **Then** the provenance system records all interactions, tool usage, and
   decision points
2. **Given** pipeline progression, **When** moving from analysis through
   evaluation, **Then** the provenance system tracks the complete pipeline flow
3. **Given** error conditions, **When** errors occur, **Then** the provenance
   system records error states, recovery attempts, and final outcomes
4. **Given** successful conversion, **When** reviewing provenance, **Then**
   complete audit trails enable full reproducibility

---

### User Story 6 - Performance Monitoring (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need basic monitoring of conversion performance,
storage usage, and resource management, so I can track progress and optimize
system resources.

**Why this priority**: Important for operations but not critical for initial
functionality. Can be added once conversions are working reliably.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running conversions and verifying
that metrics (throughput, storage, response times) are logged, temporary files
are cleaned up, and large datasets are handled with memory optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** active conversions, **When** monitoring, **Then** the system tracks
   conversion throughput, storage usage, and response times
2. **Given** conversion completion, **When** cleanup runs, **Then** temporary
   files are removed and basic duplicate detection identifies redundant data
3. **Given** large dataset processing, **When** handling data, **Then** chunked
   operations optimize memory usage
4. **Given** system operations, **When** issues occur, **Then** logs capture
   DataLad operation status, performance metrics, and error conditions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when DataLad subdatasets are missing or not installed? System
  must detect and gracefully handle missing subdatasets with clear error
  messages.
- How does the system handle locked DataLad files? System must detect locked
  files and provide resolution guidance or automatic unlocking where safe.
- What happens when provenance tracking fails mid-conversion? System must
  preserve partial provenance and indicate incomplete tracking in reports.
- How does the system handle storage exhaustion during large conversions? System
  must detect low storage conditions and fail gracefully with clear messaging.
- What happens when multiple evidence sources provide contradictory metadata
  with equal confidence? System must document the conflict and require human
  resolution.
- How does the system handle corrupted or incomplete test datasets? System must
  validate dataset integrity and provide clear error messages for corrupted
  data.
