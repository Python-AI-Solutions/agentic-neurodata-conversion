# Implementation Plan: Testing and Quality Assurance Framework

**Branch**: `testing-and-quality-assurance` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**:
[spec.md](./spec.md) **Input**: Feature specification from
`/specs/testing-and-quality-assurance/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Loaded comprehensive testing framework specification with 45 functional requirements
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected Project Type: Single Python project
   → Set Structure Decision based on existing agentic_neurodata_conversion/ layout
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Constitution is template - focusing on testing best practices
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research testing patterns, tools, and frameworks
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Verify test-first principles alignment
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by
other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This feature establishes a comprehensive testing and quality assurance framework
for the agentic neurodata conversion system. It covers 8 major testing areas (45
requirements total): MCP server testing with 90%+ coverage, agent testing with
property-based and mock service support, end-to-end testing with DataLad
datasets, client library testing across Python 3.8-3.12, CI/CD pipeline
optimization, evaluation and validation frameworks for NWB/RDF outputs, testing
utilities and fixtures, and monitoring with OpenTelemetry/Prometheus. The
framework targets unit tests completing in under 5 minutes, integration tests in
under 15 minutes, and supports datasets up to 1TB with >99% validation pass
rates.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (primary), with cross-version testing for
Python 3.8-3.12 **Primary Dependencies**: pytest 7.4+, pytest-cov,
pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, Hypothesis, pytest-xdist, pytest-timeout,
pytest-benchmark, pytest-html, coverage.py, NWB Inspector, PyNWB, rdflib,
pyshacl, DataLad, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus client, FastAPI TestClient, httpx,
responses/respx, pytest-docker, faker, factory-boy **Storage**: Test artifacts
in local filesystem, test results in CI/CD artifacts, coverage data in
XML/HTML/JSON, DataLad-managed test datasets with version control **Testing**:
pytest framework with unit/integration/e2e separation, contract testing with
OpenAPI, chaos engineering with Chaos Toolkit, performance benchmarking, flaky
test detection **Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) with
Docker, Kubernetes test environments, GitHub Actions for CI/CD **Project Type**:
Single Python project with agentic_neurodata_conversion/ as main source and
tests/ directory **Performance Goals**: Unit tests <5min, integration tests
<15min, E2E tests handle up to 1TB datasets, 90%+ code coverage for core, 85%+
for clients, <1ms temporal alignment, 50% feedback time reduction
**Constraints**: Zero critical NWB Inspector issues, >99% validation pass rate,
OWASP security compliance, ACID properties for workflow state, cross-version
compatibility (Python 3.8-3.12), reproducible tests with deterministic mocks
**Scale/Scope**: 50+ unit tests per agent, 100+ mock scenarios, 20+ workflow
scenarios, 15+ format combinations, 50+ error handling scenarios, datasets from
1MB to 1TB, 8 major testing areas, 45 functional requirements

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Note**: Project constitution is a template. This testing framework
implementation will focus on industry-standard testing best practices.

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - Framework aligns with testing best practices and
project needs

**Structure Decision**: Single Python project structure using the existing
agentic_neurodata_conversion/ directory as the main source. Tests are organized
by type (unit/integration/e2e) with subdirectories matching the source
structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Output**: research.md with technology decisions, best practices, and
implementation patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/\*.json, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**Estimated Output**: 50-60 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md) **Phase 4**:
Implementation (execute tasks.md following TDD principles) **Phase 5**:
Validation (run full test suite, generate coverage/quality reports, verify
acceptance scenarios)

## Complexity Tracking

**No violations identified** - The testing framework follows standard testing
best practices and aligns with test-first principles.

## Progress Tracking
