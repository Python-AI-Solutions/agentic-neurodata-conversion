# Tasks: Testing and Quality Assurance Framework

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/testing-and-quality-assurance/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/,
quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Loaded: Python 3.12+, pytest, Hypothesis, DataLad, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 15 entities across 3 categories (Test, Validation, Reporting)
   → contracts/: 3 JSON schemas (pytest config, test report, validation rule)
   → research.md: 12 technology decisions
   → quickstart.md: Test execution guide
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: pytest configuration, dependencies, test structure
   → Tests: Contract schemas, mock services, fixtures
   → Core: Testing utilities, validation framework, reporting
   → Integration: CI/CD pipeline, DataLad datasets, monitoring
   → Polish: Documentation, optimization, benchmarking
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different test files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Shared utilities = sequential
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T060)
6. SUCCESS: 60 tasks ready for execution
```

## Notes

### Task Execution Guidelines

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Sequential tasks** = modify same files or have dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing actual code (TDD)
- **Commit after each task** for clean history
- **Run full test suite** after each phase completion
