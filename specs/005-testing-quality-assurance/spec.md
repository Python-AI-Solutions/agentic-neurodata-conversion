# Feature Specification: Testing and Quality Assurance Framework

**Feature Branch**: 005-testing-quality-assurance
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Primary User Story

As a developer working on the agentic neurodata conversion system, I need a comprehensive automated testing and quality assurance framework so that I can confidently develop, refactor, and deploy changes knowing that all components (MCP servers, agents, client libraries, and integrations) are validated through automated tests that run on every commit, provide clear feedback on failures, and enforce quality gates before merging.

## 2. Acceptance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CI System Automatic Testing on Commits
**Given** a developer pushes commits to a feature branch
**When** the CI system detects the new commits
**Then** all test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end) execute automatically
**And** test results are reported back to the pull request
**And** failures block the merge until resolved

### Scenario 2: MCP Server Endpoint Validation
**Given** the MCP server is running with all registered tools
**When** endpoint validation tests execute
**Then** each tool endpoint is tested for correct request/response handling
**And** error conditions return appropriate error messages
**And** coverage metrics confirm all endpoints are tested

### Scenario 3: Individual Agent Testing with Mocks
**Given** an agent implementation that depends on external services
**When** unit tests run for that agent
**Then** external dependencies are mocked appropriately
**And** agent logic is validated in isolation
**And** edge cases and error conditions are covered

### Scenario 4: End-to-End Testing with DataLad Datasets
**Given** a complete workflow from data discovery to NWB conversion
**When** end-to-end tests execute using real DataLad datasets
**Then** the entire pipeline completes successfully
**And** output NWB files are validated against schemas
**And** conversion quality metrics meet acceptance thresholds

### Scenario 5: Client Library Integration Testing
**Given** Python and TypeScript client libraries for the MCP server
**When** integration tests run against a live MCP server instance
**Then** all client library methods successfully invoke server tools
**And** responses are correctly parsed and returned
**And** error handling works as expected

### Scenario 6: Quality Gates for PR Merging
**Given** a pull request ready for review
**When** automated quality checks run
**Then** test coverage must meet minimum thresholds (80%+)
**And** all tests must pass
**And** code quality metrics (linting, type checking) must pass
**And** only then is the PR eligible for merge

### Scenario 7: Test Failure Investigation
**Given** a test failure occurs in CI
**When** a developer investigates the failure
**Then** detailed logs and stack traces are available
**And** test artifacts (screenshots, dumps) are preserved
**And** failure context clearly indicates the root cause

### Scenario 8: NWB Conversion Validation
**Given** a DataLad dataset has been converted to NWB format
**When** validation tests run on the output
**Then** NWB files conform to schema requirements
**And** scientific data integrity is verified
**And** metadata completeness is confirmed
**And** conversion accuracy metrics are within acceptable ranges

## 3. Edge Cases and Error Conditions

1. **Test Flakiness**: Tests that pass/fail intermittently due to timing issues, race conditions, or environmental factors
2. **CI Environment Failures**: CI infrastructure issues causing test failures unrelated to code changes
3. **Mock Drift**: Mocked dependencies diverging from actual service behavior over time
4. **Large Dataset Timeouts**: End-to-end tests timing out when processing large DataLad datasets
5. **Network-Dependent Test Failures**: Tests failing due to network connectivity issues or external service unavailability
6. **Parallel Test Conflicts**: Tests interfering with each other when run in parallel (shared state, file conflicts)
7. **Platform-Specific Failures**: Tests passing on one OS but failing on another (Windows/Linux/macOS)
8. **Memory Leaks in Long-Running Tests**: Tests consuming excessive memory over time
9. **Version Compatibility Issues**: Tests failing due to dependency version mismatches between local and CI environments
10. **Incomplete Test Cleanup**: Tests not properly cleaning up resources (files, database connections, processes)
11. **Schema Evolution Breaks**: NWB schema updates breaking existing validation tests
12. **Coverage Metric Gaming**: Code structured to pass coverage thresholds without meaningful testing
13. **False Positives in Quality Gates**: Quality checks incorrectly blocking valid PRs
