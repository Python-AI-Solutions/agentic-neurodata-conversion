## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the expected scale and performance profile for this system? ‚Üí A: Multi-lab research (100-1000 NWB files, 1-10GB graphs, 5-10 concurrent users)
- Q: How should the system handle conflicting metadata enrichment suggestions? ‚Üí A: Confidence-based priority (highest confidence wins, ties go to most recent)
- Q: How should the system handle schema updates that break compatibility with existing knowledge graphs? ‚Üí A: Backward compatibility (new schema must be compatible with existing graphs)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Neuroscience researchers and data managers need a comprehensive knowledge graph system that automatically enriches NWB metadata, validates data against standards, and enables sophisticated semantic queries to improve data quality and scientific reproducibility in the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** incomplete metadata in an NWB file, **When** the knowledge graph system processes it, **Then** missing information is automatically filled using strain-to-species mappings and experimental protocols with confidence scoring

2. **Given** a researcher wants to validate NWB data, **When** they submit data to the system, **Then** SHACL shapes generated from NWB-LinkML schema validate the data and produce detailed compliance reports

3. **Given** a data manager needs to implement quality checks, **When** they define SPARQL queries for validation rules, **Then** the system executes complex metadata validation and enrichment rules efficiently

4. **Given** a system integrator wants to access semantic data, **When** they request knowledge graph data, **Then** the system provides JSON-LD and TTL formats through standard SPARQL endpoints

5. **Given** an agent needs to enrich metadata during conversion, **When** it queries the MCP server integration, **Then** the system provides structured responses compatible with agent interfaces

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metadata enrichment suggestions have conflicting information from different sources?
- How does the system handle NWB data structures that extend beyond the standard schema?
- What occurs when schema updates break compatibility with existing knowledge graphs?
- How does the system maintain consistency under concurrent access from multiple agents?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
