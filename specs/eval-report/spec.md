## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A neuroscience data engineer receives converted NWB files and needs to verify
their quality before sharing with researchers. They run the evaluation system
which validates files, assesses quality across multiple dimensions, and
generates comprehensive reports showing where data excels and where improvements
are needed. The system must work reliably even when external validation tools
are unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid NWB file and nwb-inspector is available, **When**
   validation is requested, **Then** the system executes nwb-inspector with
   configurable timeout, parses results into structured format, and returns
   detailed validation findings with severity levels

2. **Given** nwb-inspector is unavailable or timing out repeatedly, **When**
   circuit breaker activates, **Then** the system switches to fallback
   validation, provides partial quality assessment, and communicates degraded
   mode with recovery guidance

3. **Given** a validated NWB file, **When** comprehensive quality assessment is
   requested, **Then** the system evaluates technical, scientific, and usability
   quality in parallel, returning detailed scores and specific improvement
   recommendations for each dimension

4. **Given** quality assessment results, **When** HTML report is requested,
   **Then** the system generates interactive HTML with embedded visualizations,
   uses clear color coding, works offline, and displays correctly in modern
   browsers

5. **Given** quality assessment results, **When** multiple report formats are
   requested, **Then** the system produces consistent reports in Markdown, HTML,
   PDF, and JSON while optimizing presentation for each format

6. **Given** the evaluation system integrated with MCP server, **When** an agent
   requests quality evaluation, **Then** the system validates request, executes
   evaluation with proper isolation, returns structured responses, responds to
   health checks within 1 second, and logs all requests

### Edge Cases

- What happens when nwb-inspector crashes mid-execution? System must detect
  timeout/failure, trigger circuit breaker, and provide partial results
- How does system handle corrupt NWB files? Must catch parsing errors early,
  provide clear diagnostics, and attempt to assess readable portions
- What if one quality dimension assessment fails? System must continue with
  other dimensions, report partial results, and indicate which failed
- How does system handle concurrent MCP requests? Must isolate request contexts,
  prevent shared state mutations, maintain separate audit trails
- What if report generation fails for one format? Must generate available
  formats, log failures, inform user which succeeded
