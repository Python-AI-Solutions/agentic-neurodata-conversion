## Relevant Constitutional Requirements

**This feature implements Constitution Principle II (TDD) and uses Principle III (Schema-First) for test data entities:**

### II. Test-Driven Development ⚠️ THIS FEATURE IMPLEMENTS TDD
- This testing framework ENFORCES the TDD workflow
- Coverage gates: ≥85% standard, ≥90% critical paths
- Tests written before implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

### III. Schema-First Development (Applies to test entities)
- Test data entities (TestSuite, TestDataset, TestReport, etc.) MUST have LinkML schemas
- Schemas define test data structures before implementation
- Generate Pydantic validators from schemas for test data validation

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What failure rate should trigger automatic flagging of a test as "flaky" in the CI/CD system? → A: 5% (flag tests failing 1 in 20 runs - balanced approach, industry standard)
- Q: When critical external tools (NWB Inspector, coverage tools, validators) are unavailable during test execution, how should the system respond? → A: Retry with exponential backoff (3-5 attempts before failing - handles transient issues)
- Q: What should be the limit for concurrent test execution in the CI/CD environment? → A: Unlimited horizontal scaling with cloud runners (dynamic scaling based on test queue - fastest feedback)
- Q: When (if ever) should the testing system prioritize test execution speed over thoroughness? → A: Never prioritize speed - always run full test suite (maximum quality, no shortcuts)
- Q: How long should test artifacts (datasets, execution logs, reports, screenshots) be retained? → A: Indefinite - permanent retention for all test artifacts (maximum traceability for historical analysis)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I need a comprehensive testing framework that validates MCP server, agents, clients, and conversion workflows while enforcing TDD principles and ensuring scientific correctness through automated testing with real datasets.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** MCP server endpoints, **When** unit tests execute, **Then** ≥90% coverage achieved with malformed requests, auth, rate limiting, timeouts, and concurrent processing tested (Req 1.1)

2. **Given** agent coordination workflows, **When** integration tests run, **Then** 20+ scenarios validated including sequential/parallel execution, state persistence, error propagation, retry logic, circuit breakers (Req 1.2)

3. **Given** API contracts defined, **When** contract tests execute, **Then** 100% OpenAPI specification coverage verified with schema validation, required fields, data types, enums, formats (Req 1.3)

4. **Given** agent logic implemented, **When** agent unit tests run, **Then** 50+ test cases per agent covering input validation, transformations, algorithms, error handling, edge cases, performance, memory leaks (Req 2.1)

5. **Given** external dependencies, **When** mocking framework used, **Then** 100+ mock scenarios available including LLM services, file systems, network conditions, time manipulation, APIs (Req 2.3)

6. **Given** real neuroscience datasets, **When** E2E tests execute, **Then** DataLad-managed datasets (Open Ephys, SpikeGLX, behavioral) used with version control for reproducibility (Req 3.1)

7. **Given** converted NWB files, **When** validation runs, **Then** >99% pass rate with NWB Inspector (zero critical), PyNWB compliance, data integrity, temporal alignment <1ms, metadata >95% complete (Req 3.3)

8. **Given** code committed, **When** CI/CD triggers, **Then** tests run on Python 3.8-3.12, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, with security scanning, within 5min (unit) and 15min (integration) (Req 5.1, 5.3)

### Edge Cases
- Corrupted test datasets → detect corruption, report specific issues, handle gracefully without cascading failures
- Agent failures during integration testing → verify error propagation, exponential backoff retry, circuit breaker activation, graceful degradation
- Flaky tests → automatically flag tests with ≥5% failure rate (failing 1 in 20 runs), implement retry logic with exponential backoff, quarantine consistently flaky tests, notify test owners
- Performance regression → detect degradation vs established baselines, alert maintainers, identify bottlenecks
- Test environment provisioning failure → retry provisioning, fallback to alternative configurations, report infrastructure issues
- Scientific correctness validation → automated criteria, compare against known-good baselines, flag cases requiring expert review
- Third-party tool unavailability (NWB Inspector, coverage tools) → retry with exponential backoff (3-5 attempts with increasing delays), fail test execution if tool remains unavailable, log detailed error context, alert infrastructure team
