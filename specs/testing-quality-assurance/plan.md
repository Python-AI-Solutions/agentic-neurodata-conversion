# Implementation Plan: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Branch**: `testing-quality-assurance` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/testing-quality-assurance/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This feature implements a comprehensive testing and quality assurance framework that validates MCP server functionality, agent implementations, client libraries, and end-to-end conversion workflows. The framework enforces Constitution Principle II (TDD) by implementing the testing infrastructure itself, and uses Principle III (Schema-First) for test data entities. Key capabilities include unit/integration/contract/E2E testing with ≥85% coverage gates, DataLad-managed test datasets for reproducible testing, NWB validation with >99% pass rates, CI/CD automation with unlimited horizontal scaling, comprehensive evaluation/validation, testing utilities, and monitoring/observability infrastructure.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.8-3.12 (multi-version testing required)
**Primary Dependencies**: pytest (testing framework), pytest-cov (coverage), pytest-asyncio (async testing), pytest-mock (mocking), DataLad Python API (dataset management), NWB Inspector (validation), PyNWB (NWB compliance), LinkML (schema validation), Pydantic (data validation from schemas), OpenAPI validators (contract testing)
**Storage**: DataLad git-annex for test datasets, permanent archival storage for test artifacts (logs, reports, coverage data), GIN storage for large test files >10MB
**Testing**: This IS the testing feature - implements pytest infrastructure with custom fixtures, markers, plugins for test categorization (unit/integration/contract/e2e), parallel execution, flaky test detection (5% threshold), mocking framework (LLM, filesystem, network, time)
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (CI matrix testing), cloud runners for unlimited horizontal scaling
**Project Type**: single (test framework as library/infrastructure for entire project)
**Performance Goals**: Unit tests <5min execution, integration tests <15min execution, E2E tests with DataLad datasets <30min, 50% feedback time reduction via parallel execution, detect performance regression vs baselines
**Constraints**: ≥85% coverage (≥90% critical paths), 100% OpenAPI contract coverage, >99% NWB validation pass rate, 5% flaky test threshold, retry with exponential backoff (3-5 attempts) for external tool unavailability, never compromise thoroughness for speed (optimize via parallelization not reduction)
**Scale/Scope**: 50+ agent test cases per agent, 20+ integration scenarios, 100+ mock scenarios, 15+ format combinations for E2E tests, 100+ predefined fixtures, test suite supporting workflows up to 1TB

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure. Testing framework is implemented as a package (`agentic_neurodata_conversion/testing/`) that extends the existing `tests/` directory with infrastructure, utilities, and framework components. Framework components are tested in `tests/testing_framework/` following TDD principles (the testing framework tests itself).

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Objective**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for testing framework implementation.

### Research Tasks

Since Technical Context has no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers (all clarifications resolved in /clarify phase), research focuses on best practices and patterns:

1. **pytest Advanced Patterns**:
   - Decision: Research pytest plugin architecture for extensibility (FR-041)
   - Rationale: Custom fixtures, markers, and test discovery mechanisms needed
   - Investigation: pytest hooks, plugin system, fixture factories, custom markers

2. **DataLad Python API for Test Datasets**:
   - Decision: Research DataLad Python API patterns for test dataset management
   - Rationale: Constitution V requires DataLad for all data operations, E2E tests need version-controlled datasets (FR-013)
   - Investigation: datalad.api usage, dataset creation/cloning, git-annex integration, GIN storage configuration

3. **Mock Service Patterns**:
   - Decision: Research mocking patterns for external services (LLM, filesystem, network)
   - Rationale: 100+ mock scenarios required (FR-009), deterministic testing needed
   - Investigation: pytest-mock advanced usage, VCR.py for HTTP mocking, time-machine for time manipulation, in-memory filesystem libraries

4. **Parallel Test Execution at Scale**:
   - Decision: Research pytest-xdist and cloud runner integration for unlimited horizontal scaling
   - Rationale: Clarification specified unlimited horizontal scaling with cloud runners (FR-029)
   - Investigation: pytest-xdist configuration, GitHub Actions matrix strategy, test distribution algorithms, resource-aware scheduling

5. **Flaky Test Detection**:
   - Decision: Research flaky test detection at 5% threshold with quarantine mechanisms
   - Rationale: Clarification specified 5% failure rate triggers flaky flag
   - Investigation: pytest-flaky, pytest-rerunfailures, custom pytest plugins for statistical flaky detection, quarantine mechanisms

6. **Contract Testing with OpenAPI**:
   - Decision: Research OpenAPI-based contract testing for 100% coverage
   - Rationale: FR-003 requires 100% OpenAPI coverage, FR-008 requires schema validation
   - Investigation: schemathesis, openapi-core validators, contract test generation from OpenAPI specs

7. **Test Data Retention Architecture**:
   - Decision: Research archival storage patterns for permanent test artifact retention
   - Rationale: Clarification specified indefinite retention with cost optimization
   - Investigation: Object storage (S3/GCS) lifecycle policies, compression strategies, indexed query systems, cost-optimized storage tiers

8. **NWB Validation Integration**:
   - Decision: Research NWB Inspector Python API integration patterns
   - Rationale: FR-015 requires >99% pass rate with NWB Inspector, FR-031 requires importance-weighted scoring
   - Investigation: nwbinspector Python API, PyNWB validation, custom validation rules, automated quality scoring

**Output**: [research.md](research.md) with decisions, rationale, and alternatives for each area

### 3. Contract Tests

Generate contract test stubs (RED phase - must fail):

```python
# tests/testing_framework/contract/test_execution_api_contract.py
def test_execute_test_suite_contract():
    """Contract test for POST /test-suites/{suite_id}/execute"""
    # This test will fail initially (RED phase)
    assert False, "Contract test not implemented - implementation needed"

# tests/testing_framework/contract/test_reporting_api_contract.py
def test_get_test_report_contract():
    """Contract test for GET /test-reports/{report_id}"""
    assert False, "Contract test not implemented - implementation needed"

# tests/testing_framework/contract/test_mock_service_api_contract.py
def test_create_llm_mock_contract():
    """Contract test for POST /mocks/llm"""
    assert False, "Contract test not implemented - implementation needed"
```

### 4. Integration Test Scenarios

From spec.md acceptance scenarios (lines 52-67):

**Scenario 1: MCP Server Unit Testing** (FR-001)
```gherkin
Given MCP server endpoints
When unit tests execute
Then ≥90% coverage achieved with malformed requests, auth, rate limiting, timeouts, concurrent processing tested
```

**Scenario 2: Agent Integration Testing** (FR-002)
```gherkin
Given agent coordination workflows
When integration tests run
Then 20+ scenarios validated including sequential/parallel execution, state persistence, error propagation, retry logic, circuit breakers
```

**Scenario 3: E2E Testing with DataLad** (FR-013)
```gherkin
Given real neuroscience datasets
When E2E tests execute
Then DataLad-managed datasets (Open Ephys, SpikeGLX, behavioral) used with version control for reproducibility
```

**Scenario 4: NWB Validation** (FR-015)
```gherkin
Given converted NWB files
When validation runs
Then >99% pass rate with NWB Inspector (zero critical), PyNWB compliance, data integrity, temporal alignment <1ms, metadata >95% complete
```

**Scenario 5: CI/CD Automation** (FR-025)
```gherkin
Given code committed
When CI/CD triggers
Then tests run on Python 3.8-3.12, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, with security scanning, within 5min (unit) and 15min (integration)
```

### 5. Quickstart Test (`quickstart.md`)

Interactive test scenario that validates primary user story:

```markdown
# Testing Framework Quickstart

This quickstart validates the primary user story from spec.md:
"As a developer, I need a comprehensive testing framework that validates MCP server, agents, clients, and conversion workflows while enforcing TDD principles and ensuring scientific correctness through automated testing with real datasets."

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8-3.12
- pixi installed
- DataLad configured

## Steps

1. **Provision test environment**
   ```bash
   pixi run python -c "from agentic_neurodata_conversion.testing.core.runner import provision_environment; provision_environment('python3.11', 'ubuntu')"
   ```
   Expected: TestEnvironment created with python_version='3.11', os='ubuntu'

2. **Execute MCP server unit tests**
   ```bash
   pixi run pytest tests/unit/mcp_server/ -v --cov --cov-report=term
   ```
   Expected: ≥90% coverage, all tests pass

3. **Run agent integration tests**
   ```bash
   pixi run pytest tests/integration/agents/ -v --count=20
   ```
   Expected: 20+ scenarios pass, error propagation verified

4. **Execute E2E test with DataLad dataset**
   ```bash
   pixi run pytest tests/e2e/test_openephys_conversion.py -v
   ```
   Expected: DataLad dataset loaded, conversion succeeds, NWB validation >99% pass rate

5. **Generate test report**
   ```bash
   pixi run python -c "from agentic_neurodata_conversion.testing.core.reporter import generate_report; generate_report('latest', format='HTML')"
   ```
   Expected: HTML report with coverage metrics, performance benchmarks, quality metrics

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All test categories execute successfully
- ✅ Coverage gates satisfied (≥85% standard, ≥90% critical)
- ✅ NWB validation >99% pass rate
- ✅ Test report generated with actionable metrics
```

### 6. Update Agent Context

Execute the update script incrementally:
```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude
```

This updates CLAUDE.md with:
- NEW: Testing framework context (pytest, DataLad Python API, NWB Inspector)
- NEW: Test execution patterns (parallel execution, flaky detection, mocking)
- Recent changes: Testing framework feature added (2025-10-10)

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/*.yaml, contract test stubs (failing), quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. **Load base template**: `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`
2. **Schema-First tasks** (Constitution III):
   - Task 1-8: Define LinkML schemas for 8 test entities (TestSuite, TestDataset, TestReport, MockService, TestFixture, QualityMetric, TestEnvironment, MonitoringData) [P]
   - Task 9-16: Generate Pydantic validators from LinkML schemas [P]
   - Task 17-24: Create schema validation tests for each entity (RED phase) [P]

3. **Contract test tasks** (TDD - RED phase):
   - Task 25-27: Create contract tests for Test Execution API (3 endpoints) [P]
   - Task 28-30: Create contract tests for Test Reporting API (3 endpoints) [P]
   - Task 31-33: Create contract tests for Mock Service API (3 endpoints) [P]

4. **Core infrastructure implementation tasks** (GREEN phase):
   - Task 34: Implement test suite runner (makes execution tests pass)
   - Task 35: Implement test reporter (makes reporting tests pass)
   - Task 36: Implement mock service manager (makes mock tests pass)
   - Task 37: Implement DataLad dataset manager (E2E prerequisite)

5. **Testing utilities tasks** (FR-037, FR-039, FR-040):
   - Task 38-40: Implement fixture factories, assertion helpers, debugging utilities [P]
   - Task 41: Implement test data generators
   - Task 42: Implement test data retention with archival storage

6. **Integration test tasks** (TDD):
   - Task 43-47: Create integration tests for 5 acceptance scenarios from spec.md [P]
   - Task 48-52: Implement features to make integration tests pass

7. **CI/CD configuration tasks**:
   - Task 53: Configure pytest with parallel execution, flaky detection (5% threshold)
   - Task 54: Configure CI matrix (Python 3.8-3.12, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows)
   - Task 55: Configure unlimited horizontal scaling with cloud runners
   - Task 56: Configure permanent artifact retention with archival storage

8. **Validation tasks**:
   - Task 57: Integrate NWB Inspector for >99% pass rate validation
   - Task 58: Implement quality metrics tracking and trending
   - Task 59: Execute quickstart.md validation
   - Task 60: Verify coverage gates (≥85% standard, ≥90% critical)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD order**: Schema tests → schemas → contract tests → implementation → integration tests
- **Dependency order**: Schemas first (Constitution III), then infrastructure, then utilities, then CI/CD
- **Parallelization**: Mark [P] for independent tasks (schema definitions, contract tests, utility implementations)

**Estimated Output**: 60 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following TDD: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
**Phase 5**: Validation (/analyze + quickstart.md execution + coverage verification)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations detected. All 7 principles apply and compliance is demonstrated:
- ✅ MCP-Centric: Tests validate MCP endpoints and workflows
- ✅ TDD: This feature implements TDD infrastructure
- ✅ Schema-First: 8 test entities require LinkML schemas
- ✅ Feature Boundaries: Self-contained testing framework with clear APIs
- ✅ Data Integrity: DataLad for test datasets with version control
- ✅ Quality-First: Implements coverage gates and quality validation
- ✅ Spec-Kit Workflow: Followed /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /analyze gates

**No complexity deviations to justify.**

- **No cross-feature dependencies**: Testing framework operates independently, validates other features through MCP

### V. Data Integrity & Complete Provenance ✅ PASS
- **Design Compliance**: DataLad Python API integration documented (research.md section 2)
- **Test datasets**: Version-controlled with DataLad, git-annex for files >10MB
- **No violations introduced**: All test data operations use DataLad API

### VI. Quality-First Development ✅ PASS
- **Design Compliance**: Coverage gates (≥85% standard, ≥90% critical) enforced in design
- **Flaky detection**: 5% threshold with quarantine mechanism (research.md section 5)
- **Quality metrics**: QualityMetric entity tracks coverage, performance, error rates, scientific accuracy, compliance

### VII. Spec-Kit Workflow Gates ✅ PASS
- **Design Compliance**: Following complete workflow (/specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /analyze → /implement)
- **Quickstart**: Validates workflow gates in interactive testing
- **No violations introduced**: Design phase complete, ready for /tasks

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: ✅ PASS - All 7 principles remain satisfied after Phase 1 design. No violations introduced. No refactoring required.
