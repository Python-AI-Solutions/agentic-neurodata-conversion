# Research & Technical Decisions
**Feature**: Agent-Based Neurodata Conversion System
**Date**: 2025-10-03

## Research Areas

### 1. Agent Framework Selection

**Decision**: Custom agent implementation using MCP (Model Context Protocol) as the foundation

**Rationale**:
- The project already has MCP infrastructure in place (mcp_server package exists)
- MCP provides a standardized protocol for tool integration and agent communication
- Custom implementation allows fine-grained control over agent behavior specific to neurodata conversion
- Avoids heavyweight framework dependencies that may not align with scientific data processing needs
- Better integration with existing pynwb and neuroconv tools

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **LangChain**: Full-featured agent framework with extensive tooling
  - Rejected: Too heavyweight, adds unnecessary abstractions for our specific use case
  - Rejected: Additional learning curve for neuroscience-focused developers
  - Rejected: May introduce version conflicts with scientific libraries
- **LlamaIndex**: Data-focused agent framework
  - Rejected: Optimized for document retrieval, not workflow orchestration
  - Rejected: Less suitable for multi-step conversion pipelines
- **AutoGPT/BabyAGI**: Autonomous agent frameworks
  - Rejected: Too autonomous, we need human-in-the-loop oversight
  - Rejected: Not designed for scientific workflow management

### 2. Natural Language Processing Approach

**Decision**: Intent classification using pattern matching + LLM-based clarification

**Rationale**:
- Start with rule-based pattern matching for common conversion patterns (high precision, low latency)
- Use LLM (via MCP tools) for ambiguous cases and clarification questions
- Hybrid approach balances speed with flexibility
- Allows graceful degradation if LLM is unavailable
- Pattern matching can learn from conversation history

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Pure LLM-based**: Every request goes through LLM
  - Rejected: Higher latency and cost for routine conversions
  - Rejected: Less predictable behavior for standardized workflows
- **Traditional NLP (spaCy, NLTK)**: Entity recognition and dependency parsing
  - Rejected: Requires extensive training data specific to neurodata terminology
  - Rejected: Less flexible for handling informal user descriptions
- **Fine-tuned domain model**: Custom model trained on neuroscience conversations
  - Rejected: Requires large labeled dataset not currently available
  - Rejected: High maintenance overhead for model updates

### 3. Workflow Orchestration Pattern

**Decision**: AsyncIO-based task queue with state machine workflow execution

**Rationale**:
- Python's asyncio provides built-in concurrency without additional dependencies
- State machine pattern clearly models conversion workflow stages (init → profile → select → execute → validate → complete)
- Supports resumable workflows via state persistence
- Clean separation between orchestration logic and tool execution
- Easy to test and debug with explicit state transitions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue
  - Rejected: Requires message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), adds deployment complexity
  - Rejected: Overkill for single-machine concurrent execution
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration platform
  - Rejected: Too heavyweight for embedded agent use
  - Rejected: Designed for scheduled DAGs, not conversational workflows
- **Temporal**: Durable workflow engine
  - Rejected: Requires separate Temporal server infrastructure
  - Rejected: Learning curve and operational overhead
- **Python threading/multiprocessing**: Standard library concurrency
  - Rejected: Harder to manage async I/O operations
  - Rejected: asyncio provides better async/await patterns

### 4. State Persistence Mechanism

**Decision**: JSON file-based persistence with optional SQLite upgrade path

**Rationale**:
- JSON files are human-readable for debugging
- No external database dependency for basic use
- Easy to implement with Python's standard library
- Supports versioning and migration via JSON schema
- Can upgrade to SQLite when multi-user scenarios emerge
- Aligns with file-based nature of NWB data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database
  - Rejected: Requires database server setup
  - Rejected: Overkill for single-user conversion tracking
- **Redis**: In-memory data store
  - Rejected: Requires Redis server
  - Rejected: Data lost on restart (need persistence)
- **SQLite**: Embedded SQL database
  - Considered for future: Good upgrade path from JSON
  - Not chosen initially: JSON simpler for MVP and debugging
- **MongoDB**: Document database
  - Rejected: Requires MongoDB server
  - Rejected: More complexity than needed

### 5. NWB Tool Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Adapter pattern with isolated subprocess execution

**Rationale**:
- Adapter pattern provides consistent interface to pynwb, neuroconv, and future tools
- Subprocess isolation prevents version conflicts between conversion tools
- Clean error handling and timeout management
- Supports multiple tool versions in parallel
- Easy to mock for testing without actual conversions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Direct library imports**: Import pynwb/neuroconv directly
  - Rejected: Potential version conflicts if tools require different dependencies
  - Rejected: Memory leaks from long-running conversion processes
- **Docker containers per tool**: Containerize each conversion tool
  - Rejected: Adds Docker dependency
  - Rejected: Higher overhead for quick conversions
  - Considered for future: Good for complex tool chains
- **Plugin system**: Dynamic plugin loading
  - Rejected: Unnecessary complexity for initial tool set
  - Considered for future: When tool ecosystem grows
- **gRPC/REST wrappers**: Each tool as microservice
  - Rejected: Deployment complexity
  - Rejected: Network overhead for local conversions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Architecture
- Base agent interface defines: perceive, decide, act cycle
- Conversation agent handles natural language understanding
- Orchestrator agent coordinates workflow execution
- Decision agent records reasoning for transparency

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for conversation, tasks, workflows, metrics
- OpenAPI schema for contract testing
- AsyncIO-compatible request handlers
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time status updates

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual agents and services
- Contract tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for tool adapters
- End-to-end tests simulating user scenarios
- Mock LLM responses for deterministic testing

### Performance Considerations
- Concurrent task execution limited by configurable resource pool
- FIFO queue for fair task scheduling
- Lazy loading of conversion tools (load on first use)
- Streaming validation results for large files
- Progress callbacks for long-running operations

## Open Questions & Future Research
- Should we support plugin-based custom conversion tools?
- What metrics should trigger automatic workflow optimization?
- How to handle version migration for persisted state?
- Should we add support for distributed execution (multi-node)?
- Integration with knowledge graph for automatic metadata enrichment?
