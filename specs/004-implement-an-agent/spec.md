# Feature Specification: Agent-Based Neurodata Conversion System

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-an-agent`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement an agent-based system for neurodata conversion that can autonomously handle conversion tasks, coordinate between different conversion tools, manage workflows, and interact with users through natural language to gather requirements and report progress."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher has neurophysiology data in a proprietary format that needs to be converted to NWB format. They interact with the agent through natural language to describe their data, specify conversion requirements, and monitor progress. The agent autonomously determines the appropriate conversion tools, coordinates the workflow, handles errors, and reports completion with validation results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher has raw neurodata files, **When** they request conversion through natural language, **Then** the agent gathers requirements, selects appropriate conversion tools, executes the workflow, and provides converted NWB files with validation results
2. **Given** a conversion task is in progress, **When** the researcher asks for status, **Then** the agent provides current progress, estimated completion time, and any issues encountered
3. **Given** multiple conversion tasks are queued, **When** new tasks arrive, **Then** the agent prioritizes tasks by submission time (FIFO)
4. **Given** a conversion fails, **When** the agent encounters an error, **Then** the agent attempts recovery, reports the issue to the user in natural language, and suggests corrective actions
5. **Given** a user is unfamiliar with conversion options, **When** they describe their data informally, **Then** the agent asks clarifying questions to determine data format, recording modality, and output requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the agent cannot determine the appropriate conversion tool for a given data format?
- How does the system handle partial conversions when some data channels succeed and others fail?
- What happens when conversion tools have conflicting requirements or incompatible versions?
- How does the agent handle ambiguous or incomplete user descriptions?
- What happens when a long-running conversion is interrupted?
- How does the system manage resource constraints when multiple large conversions run simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept user requests in natural language describing neurodata conversion needs
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify data format, recording modality, and conversion target from user descriptions
- **FR-003**: System MUST ask clarifying questions when user descriptions are incomplete or ambiguous
- **FR-004**: System MUST autonomously select appropriate conversion tools based on data characteristics
- **FR-005**: System MUST coordinate multi-step conversion workflows involving multiple tools
- **FR-006**: System MUST execute conversion tasks without requiring user intervention for routine operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST monitor conversion progress and detect failures or errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide status updates to users in natural language upon request
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate converted NWB files against schema requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST report validation results and conversion quality metrics to users
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle multiple concurrent conversion tasks with configurable limits based on available memory and CPU resources
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist conversion task state to support resumption after interruptions
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all conversion operations, decisions, and outcomes until the final conversion report is generated
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with NWB conversion tools
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide error messages and recovery suggestions in user-friendly language
- **FR-016**: System MUST track conversion metrics including success rate, duration, and error types with raw data retention and weekly aggregation
- **FR-017**: System MUST support workflow customization for different data types through natural language conversations with the agent
- **FR-018**: System MUST notify users upon conversion completion via in-system messages and provide an endpoint for integration with external notification systems
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow configuration of maximum concurrent tasks based on system resources

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Conversion Task**: Represents a single conversion job with source data, target format, selected tools, current status, progress metrics, error history, submission timestamp, and completion results
- **Workflow**: Defines the sequence of conversion steps, tool invocations, and validation checks required for a specific data type or conversion scenario
- **Data Profile**: Describes characteristics of source neurodata including format, modality, structure, metadata, and quality indicators that inform tool selection
- **Agent Decision**: Records the agent's reasoning for tool selection, workflow construction, and error handling to support transparency and debugging
- **Validation Report**: Contains schema compliance results, data integrity checks, and quality metrics for converted NWB files
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains user interaction history, clarifications, preferences, and requirements to support coherent multi-turn dialogues
- **Resource Configuration**: Defines memory and CPU limits that determine concurrent task capacity
- **Metrics Aggregate**: Weekly summaries of conversion statistics including success rates, average duration, and error patterns
