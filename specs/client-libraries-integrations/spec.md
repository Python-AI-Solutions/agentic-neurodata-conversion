## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer or researcher, I want to interact with the agentic neurodata
conversion system through a Python client library and CLI tool, so that I can
convert neuroscience data programmatically or from the command line.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Python SDK Usage

1. **Given** a Python developer wants to convert electrophysiology data,
   **When** they install the Python SDK and initialize a client, **Then** they
   can execute conversions with typed method calls and receive structured
   responses
2. **Given** a researcher has conversion errors, **When** they examine the error
   response, **Then** they receive actionable error messages with suggested
   fixes and retry capabilities
3. **Given** a developer needs to track conversion progress, **When** they use
   async APIs with streaming support, **Then** they receive real-time status
   updates during long-running conversions

#### CLI Tool Usage

1. **Given** a researcher needs batch conversions, **When** they use the CLI in
   batch mode with a configuration file, **Then** multiple datasets are
   converted sequentially with progress indicators and summary reports
2. **Given** a developer troubleshooting conversions, **When** they use
   interactive CLI mode with verbose logging, **Then** they can step through
   conversion stages and inspect intermediate states
3. **Given** a user needs help, **When** they run CLI with --help flag, **Then**
   they see comprehensive documentation of all commands and options

### Edge Cases

- What happens when network connectivity is lost during a long-running
  conversion? (Auto-reconnection with state preservation)
- How does the system handle incompatible SDK versions communicating with the
  MCP server? (Protocol version negotiation with compatibility warnings)
- What happens when streaming responses exceed memory limits? (Backpressure
  handling with configurable buffering)
- How does the CLI handle very large batch conversion jobs? (Chunked processing
  with resume capability)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Python Client Library

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Python SDK supporting Python versions 3.8
  through 3.12 for MCP server interaction
- **FR-002**: Python SDK MUST offer both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for
  all conversion operations
- **FR-003**: Python SDK MUST include comprehensive type hints for all public
  APIs to enable IDE autocomplete and type checking
- **FR-004**: Python SDK MUST provide intuitive class-based interfaces for
  interacting with individual agents (orchestrator, analysis, conversion,
  evaluation)
- **FR-005**: SDK MUST support conversation management including session
  creation, message history, and context preservation
- **FR-006**: SDK MUST implement streaming support for real-time progress
  updates during long-running operations
- **FR-007**: SDK MUST provide error handling with automatic retry logic for
  transient failures using exponential backoff
- **FR-008**: SDK MUST provide configuration management for connection settings,
  timeouts, retry policies, and logging levels
- **FR-009**: SDK MUST include comprehensive code examples demonstrating common
  usage patterns and workflows

#### MCP Protocol Implementation

- **FR-010**: Client library MUST implement full MCP client protocol including
  request/response patterns and error handling

  operations
- **FR-017**: CLI MUST support interactive mode for step-by-step conversion
  workflow execution

  datasets
- **FR-019**: CLI MUST display progress indicators showing conversion stages and
  estimated completion time

  and reusing conversion settings
- **FR-021**: CLI MUST include comprehensive help documentation accessible via
  --help flags
- **FR-022**: CLI MUST support verbose logging modes for debugging and
  troubleshooting
- **FR-023**: CLI MUST provide output formatting options (JSON, YAML, table,
  plain text)
- **FR-024**: CLI MUST support piping input/output for Unix-style command
  chaining

#### Developer Experience

- **FR-025**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation including
  getting-started guides, API references, and tutorials
- **FR-026**: Documentation MUST include integration examples for common use
  cases
