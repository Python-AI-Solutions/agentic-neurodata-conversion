## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a neuroscience researcher, I want to validate my converted NWB files against community standards and quality metrics, so that I can ensure my data is compliant, complete, and scientifically sound before sharing it with the research community.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a newly converted NWB file, **When** I run validation, **Then** the system checks schema compliance, best practices, metadata completeness, and scientific plausibility, providing a comprehensive quality report with actionable remediation guidance.

2. **Given** a validation session with multiple files, **When** validation completes, **Then** the system aggregates results, identifies patterns, and generates trend analysis showing quality improvements over time.

3. **Given** an NWB file with validation issues, **When** I review the validation report, **Then** each issue includes severity level, specific location, explanation, and remediation steps to fix it.

4. **Given** different validation contexts (development, testing, production), **When** I configure validation settings, **Then** the system applies appropriate thresholds, filters, and rules without requiring restart.

5. **Given** domain-specific neuroscience data, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system checks scientific plausibility of experimental parameters, equipment consistency, and methodology appropriateness.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an NWB file is corrupted or cannot be opened?
- How does the system handle validation of extremely large NWB files (>100GB)?
- What happens when multiple validators produce conflicting results?
- How does the system behave when LinkML schemas are missing or invalid?
- What happens when domain knowledge rules conflict with NWB schema requirements?
- How are validation results handled when MCP integration is unavailable?

## Notes for Planning Phase

This specification covers all 8 modules defined in the requirements document. The system is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Each module can be developed and tested independently
- **Standards-compliant**: Follows NWB, FAIR, and LinkML standards
- **Extensible**: Supports custom metrics, domain rules, and validators
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging, reporting, and analytics
- **Integrated**: MCP-compatible for workflow automation

Before moving to `/plan`, the 4 clarification items should be addressed through `/clarify`.
