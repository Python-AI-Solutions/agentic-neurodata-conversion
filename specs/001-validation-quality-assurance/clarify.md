# Clarification Questions: Validation and Quality Assurance System

**Feature**: 001-validation-quality-assurance
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Awaiting Responses

## Purpose
This document contains structured questions to resolve ambiguities in the specification before creating the implementation plan. Each question is designed to reduce risk and ensure clear requirements.

## Questions

### Q1: Vocabulary Completion Suggestions (FR-016)

**Context**: Module 3 requires the system to "provide vocabulary completion suggestions for invalid terms"

**Question**: What should be the source(s) for vocabulary suggestions when invalid terms are detected?

**Options**:
- A) Ontology services (e.g., Neuroscience Information Framework, BioPortal APIs)
- B) Pre-cached/downloaded vocabulary lists (local files)
- C) Manual lookup table defined in configuration
- D) Combination of the above (please specify priority order)

**Why this matters**: Impacts architecture (API dependencies), performance (network latency), and reliability (offline capability)

**Suggested Answer**: Option D - Combination with priority: (1) Pre-cached lists for common vocabularies, (2) Ontology services as fallback with caching, (3) Manual lookup for custom/specialized terms

---

### Q2: Custom Quality Metrics Definition (FR-019)

**Context**: Module 4 requires the system to "support custom quality metrics for specific use cases"

**Question**: How should users define and add custom quality metrics?

**Options**:
- A) Configuration files (YAML/JSON with metric definitions)
- B) Plugin system (load Python modules dynamically)
- C) Code extension (inherit from base metric class and register)
- D) API-based (REST endpoints to register metrics at runtime)

**Why this matters**: Impacts developer experience, deployment complexity, security considerations, and extensibility model

**Suggested Answer**: Option C - Code extension with metric registration. Users inherit from `BaseQualityMetric` class and register via decorator or registration function. Provides type safety, better IDE support, and easier testing than configuration-based approaches.

---

### Q3: Custom Domain Rules Addition (FR-027)

**Context**: Module 5 requires the system to "allow custom domain rule sets for specialized experiments"

**Question**: How should domain experts add custom validation rules?

**Options**:
- A) Configuration files (declarative rule definitions)
- B) Python API (programmatic rule definition)
- C) DSL (Domain-Specific Language for validation rules)
- D) Hybrid (simple rules via config, complex via code)

**Why this matters**: Determines who can add rules (scientists vs. developers), learning curve, and rule complexity limits

**Suggested Answer**: Option D - Hybrid approach. Simple plausibility checks (range validation, unit consistency) via YAML/JSON configuration. Complex multi-field validation and scientific reasoning via Python API inheriting from `BaseDomainRule`.

---

### Q4a: Report Format Priority (FR-034)

**Context**: Module 7 requires "validation reports in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, PDF)"

**Question**: Are all three formats required for MVP release, or can we prioritize?

**Options**:
- A) All three formats required for MVP
- B) JSON only for MVP (machine-readable), add others in v2
- C) JSON + HTML for MVP (machine + human-readable), PDF later
- D) Configurable - at least one format required

**Why this matters**: Impacts development timeline, dependency management (PDF libraries), and MVP scope

**Suggested Answer**: Option C - JSON + HTML for MVP. JSON for programmatic access and integration, HTML for human review with embedded visualizations. PDF generation can be added post-MVP as it requires additional dependencies and rendering complexity.

---

### Q4b: Visualization Requirements (FR-036)

**Context**: Module 7 requires "visual representations of validation results"

**Question**: What types of visualizations are needed and should they be interactive?

**Visualization Types**:
- [ ] Bar charts (issue counts by severity)
- [ ] Pie charts (quality metric distribution)
- [ ] Line graphs (trends over time)
- [ ] Heatmaps (quality across file sections)
- [ ] Tables (detailed issue listings)
- [ ] Other: ________________

**Interactivity**:
- A) Static images (PNG/SVG embedded in reports)
- B) Interactive (JavaScript-based, click to drill down)
- C) Both (static for PDF, interactive for HTML)

**Why this matters**: Impacts technology choices (matplotlib vs. plotly/d3.js), file size, and user experience

**Suggested Answer**:
- **Visualization Types**: Bar charts (severity), pie charts (quality breakdown), tables (issue details), line graphs (trends)
- **Interactivity**: Option C - Static for any PDF exports, interactive for HTML reports using lightweight JavaScript library (e.g., Chart.js or Plotly). Allows drill-down into specific issues and filtering by severity.

## Response Summary

After clarification, the following decisions were made:

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Q1: Vocabulary Sources | Hybrid: cached lists + API fallback | Balance performance and coverage |
| Q2: Custom Metrics | Code extension with registration | Type safety and testability |
| Q3: Domain Rules | Hybrid: config for simple, code for complex | Accessibility for scientists, power for developers |
| Q4a: Report Formats | JSON + HTML for MVP | Core machine + human readable formats |
| Q4b: Visualizations | Bar/pie/line/table, interactive HTML | Essential analytics with good UX |

---

## Next Steps

- [x] Clarification questions documented
- [ ] Responses collected from stakeholders
- [ ] Specification updated with clarified requirements
- [ ] Ready to proceed to `/plan` phase

---

## Notes

These clarifications ensure the implementation plan will have clear guidance on:
- External dependencies and API integration strategy
- Extensibility mechanisms and plugin architecture
- MVP scope and phased delivery approach
- User experience requirements for reporting

Once responses are confirmed, the specification will be updated and the [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers removed.
