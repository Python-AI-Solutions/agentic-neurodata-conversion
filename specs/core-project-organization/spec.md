## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer joining the agentic neurodata conversion project, I want a
well-organized codebase with clear boundaries between the MCP server
orchestration layer, internal agent modules, and external integrations, so that
I can understand the architecture, navigate the code efficiently, and contribute
new features without breaking existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new developer clones the repository, **When** they examine the
   directory structure, **Then** they can identify the MCP server components
   (`mcp_server/`), agent modules (`agents/`), client implementations
   (`clients/`), and supporting infrastructure within 5 minutes using the README
   and documentation

2. **Given** a developer needs to add a new MCP tool, **When** they follow the
   development guidelines, **Then** the tool integrates seamlessly with the
   existing MCP server using standardized interfaces and passes all quality
   gates

3. **Given** a developer implements a new feature, **When** they run the
   pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline, **Then** code quality checks (linting,
   type checking, security scanning) pass and test coverage requirements are met

4. **Given** a third-party developer wants to integrate with the system,
   **When** they access the documentation and examples, **Then** they can
   implement a client integration using the provided patterns and test it
   successfully

5. **Given** a system architect reviews the codebase, **When** they examine
   module boundaries and interfaces, **Then** they confirm adherence to
   MCP-centric architecture principles with clear separation of concerns

6. **Given** a developer modifies an agent module, **When** they run the test
   suite, **Then** unit tests, integration tests, and component interaction
   tests validate the changes without breaking existing workflows

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer tries to create direct agent-to-agent
  communication bypassing the MCP server? (Should be prevented by architectural
  guidelines and code review)
- How does the system handle circular dependencies between modules? (Should be
  detected by import analysis tools)
- What happens when configuration validation fails at startup? (Should provide
  clear error messages with remediation guidance)
- How does the system support developers working across different platforms
  (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL)? (Should provide platform-specific setup scripts
  and validation)
