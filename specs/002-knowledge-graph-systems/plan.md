# Implementation Plan: Knowledge Graph Systems

**Branch**: `002-knowledge-graph-systems` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-knowledge-graph-systems/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✓ COMPLETE: Feature spec loaded and analyzed
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✓ COMPLETE: No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain after /clarify
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✓ COMPLETE: Constitution template noted, using standard practices
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✓ COMPLETE: No violations, proceeding
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✓ COMPLETE: Research completed
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✓ IN PROGRESS: Generating Phase 1 artifacts
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-Design Constitution Check pending
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → Task planning approach described
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Knowledge graph systems that enrich NWB metadata with semantic relationships, provide SPARQL query capabilities, and integrate with MCP server architecture. The system uses NWB-LinkML schema as the canonical ontology source, generates JSON-LD contexts and SHACL shapes, and maintains complete provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment through external neuroscience ontologies. Supports medium datasets (10K-100K triples) with 5-20 concurrent users, uniform access control, and project-based data retention.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (based on existing pixi.toml)
**Primary Dependencies**: rdflib, linkml, pynwb, fastapi, mcp (from pixi.toml)
**Storage**: RDF triple store (graph database), file-based schema artifacts
**Testing**: pytest (from pixi.toml)
**Target Platform**: Linux server, macOS development
**Project Type**: single (library + CLI + MCP server integration)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second SPARQL queries, support 5-20 concurrent users
**Constraints**: NWB-LinkML schema compatibility, PROV-O compliance, fail-fast on external service outages
**Scale/Scope**: Medium datasets (10K-100K triples), project-based retention, confidence-based conflict resolution

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: Constitution template not yet configured - proceeding with standard practices:
- Library-first approach with CLI interface
- Test-first development (TDD mandatory)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standard Python project structure
- No complexity violations identified

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure as this is a library/service component

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
✓ **COMPLETE**: Research phase completed with technical decisions documented in research.md

Key Research Findings:
- **RDF Store**: rdflib with file-based storage and optional in-memory graphs
- **Schema Integration**: Direct LinkML processing with artifact generation pipeline
- **Query Optimization**: Pattern-based query templates with result caching
- **Ontology Integration**: Staged approach starting with NCBITaxon for species mapping
- **Provenance**: Core PROV-O patterns with domain extensions
- **MCP Integration**: FastAPI-based async operations

**Output**: research.md with all technical unknowns resolved ✓

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete ✓*

### 1. Data Model Design → `data-model.md`
Extract entities from feature spec with semantic relationships and validation rules

### 2. API Contracts → `/contracts/`
Generate OpenAPI contracts from functional requirements:
- Metadata enrichment endpoints
- SPARQL query interface
- Schema validation endpoints
- Knowledge graph generation endpoints
- MCP server integration contracts

### 3. Contract Tests
Generate failing contract tests for TDD workflow

### 4. Integration Test Scenarios → `quickstart.md`
Extract test scenarios from user stories and acceptance criteria

### 5. Agent Context Update → `CLAUDE.md`
Run agent context update script for Claude Code integration

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Services → CLI → MCP Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Task Categories**:
- Setup: Project structure, dependencies, configuration
- Models: Entity classes with semantic relationships
- Services: Core knowledge graph operations
- API: MCP server endpoints and SPARQL interface
- Integration: External ontology connections
- Validation: Schema validation and quality assessment
- Testing: Contract, integration, and unit tests

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No complexity violations identified - following standard single-project library structure with clean separation of concerns.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
