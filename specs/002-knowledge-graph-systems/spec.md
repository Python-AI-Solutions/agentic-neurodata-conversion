# Feature Specification: Knowledge Graph Systems

**Feature Branch**: `002-knowledge-graph-systems`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Knowledge graph systems that enrich metadata, provide semantic relationships, and enable complex queries for the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline. The system uses NWB-LinkML schema as canonical ontology source, generates JSON-LD contexts, SHACL shapes, and RDF/OWL from schema. It maintains entities, relationships, and provenance information while supporting metadata enrichment through external references and domain knowledge. Includes SPARQL query engine, schema-driven validation, RDF generation, core NWB ontology integration, MCP server integration, schema management, dynamic content handling, and data quality assurance."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Expected dataset scale and concurrent load for query performance ‚Üí A: Medium datasets: 10K-100K triples, 5-20 concurrent users
- Q: User roles needing differentiated permissions ‚Üí A: Single role: All authenticated users have same access
- Q: Data retention period for knowledge graph data ‚Üí A: Project-based: Retain for duration of research project
- Q: Fallback behavior when external ontology services are unavailable ‚Üí A: Fail fast: Return error and halt enrichment process
- Q: Conflict resolution strategy for multiple ontology sources ‚Üí A: Confidence scoring: Select highest confidence mapping with evidence

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher using the agentic neurodata conversion pipeline, I need a knowledge graph system that automatically enriches my NWB metadata with semantic relationships and domain knowledge, validates data against standardized schemas, and enables complex queries to ensure data quality and completeness throughout the conversion process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** incomplete NWB metadata with missing species information, **When** the knowledge graph system processes the metadata, **Then** it automatically suggests and fills the missing species data based on strain mappings with confidence scores and evidence trails
2. **Given** converted NWB data, **When** validation is requested, **Then** the system validates against NWB-LinkML schema using SHACL shapes and provides detailed compliance reports
3. **Given** a SPARQL query for experimental protocols, **When** executed against the knowledge graph, **Then** the system returns semantically enriched results with relationships to devices, subjects, and datasets
4. **Given** updated NWB-LinkML schema, **When** schema changes occur, **Then** the system automatically regenerates JSON-LD contexts and SHACL shapes while maintaining version provenance

### Edge Cases
- When external ontology services are unavailable during metadata enrichment, the system returns an error and halts the enrichment process
- When conflicting information exists from multiple ontology sources, the system selects the mapping with highest confidence score and supporting evidence
- What occurs when unknown NWB data structures are encountered beyond the standard schema?
- How are concurrent access patterns managed when multiple agents query the knowledge graph simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
