**conclusion**  
I tried various automated methods to find more datasets programmatically. This included testing different API connections, creating custom search filters, and adjusting search settings to find the best results. I used multiple technical approaches like direct DANDI API access and Python-based searches, but ran into consistent problems with access restrictions and getting the same datasets repeatedly, even when changing the search criteria. Through this process, I managed to find two additional datasets that meet our requirements.
