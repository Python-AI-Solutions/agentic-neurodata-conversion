While the CRCNS versions have some contextual metadata not found elsewhere, a sometimes easier way to find (more) of the data is through their Globus endpoint at NYU, found through their website (https://buzsakilab.com/wp/database/ -> Databank -> Globus Datasets endpoint)

Also note that for raw data, they have likely removed it from all sources (too big for CRCNS and occasionally removed from Globus too) but the backups are still on Bens drive
