## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 1: Before Upload (Idle State)

### Before Option 2
```
User: "What is this?"
System: [No response or generic template message]
```

### After Option 2 âœ…
```bash
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/chat/smart' -F 'message=What is this tool for?'
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "This is an AI-assisted NWB conversion tool designed to help neuroscientists convert their electrophysiology data into NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) format. I can guide you through the entire conversion process, help you understand validation issues, and ensure your data meets NWB standards. To get started, you'll need to upload your data file, and I'll help you through each step!",
  "suggestions": [
    "What is NWB format and why should I use it?",
    "What types of data formats can you convert?",
    "Can you explain the conversion process?"
  ],
  "suggested_action": "upload_file"
}
```

**Result:** Natural, educational response that explains purpose + next steps

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 2: Learning About NWB

### Before Option 2
```
User: "What is NWB?"
System: [Keyword not recognized - no response]
```

### After Option 2 âœ…
```bash
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/chat/smart' -F 'message=What is NWB format?'
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) is a standardized data format created specifically for neuroscience research. It's designed to store various types of neuroscience data - from electrophysiology recordings to imaging data - in a consistent, well-documented way that makes it easier to share and analyze. Think of it as a specialized container that organizes your experimental data, metadata, and analysis results in a structured format that other researchers can easily understand and use. The format uses HDF5 as its underlying storage mechanism, which allows for efficient handling of large datasets while maintaining a hierarchical organization of your data.",
  "suggestions": [
    "What types of data can I store in NWB format?",
    "How do I start converting my data to NWB?",
    "What are the key components of an NWB file?",
    "Are there tools available to help with NWB conversion?"
  ],
  "suggested_action": "upload_file"
}
```

**Result:** Clear explanation + follow-up questions + call-to-action

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 3: Context-Aware Help

### Before Option 2
```
User: "How do I add experimenter info?"
System: [Template response - no context awareness]
```

### After Option 2 âœ…
```bash
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/chat/smart' -F 'message=How do I add experimenter info?'
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "To add experimenter information in NWB, you'll need to include it in the NWBFile constructor or modify the experimenter field after creation. The experimenter info is stored as a list of strings with the names of the experimenters. For example:\n\nnwbfile = NWBFile(\n    experimenter=['John Smith', 'Jane Doe'],\n    ...\n)\n\nHowever, **I notice you haven't uploaded a file yet**. We'll need to start with getting your data loaded before we can add the experimenter information.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Would you like to upload your data file first?",
    "Do you have other metadata you'd like to know how to add?",
    "What format is your source data in?"
  ],
  "suggested_action": "upload_file"
}
```

**Result:** Technical answer WITH context awareness ("I notice you haven't uploaded...")

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 4: Natural Intent Understanding

### Before Option 2
```
User: "Let's get started"
System: [Looks for keyword "start", may or may not trigger action]
```

### After Option 2 âœ…
```bash
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/chat/smart' -F 'message=Let me try this out'
```

**Expected LLM Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Great! I'm excited to help you convert your data. To get started, you'll need to upload your data file. I can work with various electrophysiology formats including SpikeGLX, OpenEphys, Blackrock, and more. Once you upload your file, I'll automatically detect the format and guide you through the conversion process.",
  "suggestions": [
    "What format is your data in?",
    "Do you have any questions before we start?",
    "Would you like to know what metadata I'll need?"
  ],
  "suggested_action": "upload_file"
}
```

**Result:** LLM understands intent without exact keyword match

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 5: Multiple Exchanges (Conversation Flow)

### Test Sequence
```bash
# Exchange 1
User: "What is this?"
AI: "This is an NWB conversion tool... [explanation]"

# Exchange 2
User: "What formats do you support?"
AI: "I support SpikeGLX, OpenEphys, Blackrock... [list]"

# Exchange 3
User: "Ok let's convert my SpikeGLX data"
AI: "Great! Please upload your SpikeGLX file... [action: upload_file]"

# Exchange 4 (after upload)
User: "What metadata do I need?"
AI: "Based on your file, I'll need: experimenter, institution, subject info... [contextual response]"
```

**Result:** Natural back-and-forth conversation with context preservation

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo 6: Frontend Visual Test

### Step-by-Step Frontend Demo

1. **Open Application**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/
   ```

2. **Before Upload - General Q&A**
   ```
   User types: "What can this do?"

   AI displays: "This is an AI-assisted NWB conversion tool..."

   User types: "How do I use it?"

   AI displays: "To get started, upload your data file using the button above..."
   ```

3. **Upload File**
   ```
   User uploads: toy_recording_ap.bin
   System: "File uploaded successfully!"
   ```

4. **During Conversion - Status Questions**
   ```
   User types: "What's happening now?"

   AI displays: "I'm currently converting your SpikeGLX data to NWB format. This involves detecting the format, reading the data, and creating a standardized NWB file structure..."
   ```

5. **After Validation - Issue Discussion**
   ```
   User types: "What issues were found?"

   AI displays: "I found 5 metadata issues: missing experimenter, institution, subject info, keywords, and experiment description. These are all INFO-level issues that won't prevent your file from working, but they're important for sharing your data..."

   User types: "Which ones matter most?"

   AI displays: "For DANDI submission, the experimenter and subject info are most critical. Institution and keywords improve discoverability. Experiment description helps others understand your study..."
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Side-by-Side Comparison

| Scenario | Before Option 2 | After Option 2 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **No file uploaded** | Template: "Please upload a file" | "This tool converts neuroscience data to NWB. To start, upload your file..." |
| **Ask "What is NWB?"** | No response | Full explanation + suggestions |
| **Ask "How to add metadata?"** | Template answer | Code example + context awareness |
| **Say "Let's go"** | Keyword match failure | LLM understands intent |
| **Mid-conversion question** | No response (wrong state) | Context-aware answer |
