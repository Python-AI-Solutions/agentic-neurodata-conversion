## Why Claude Sonnet 4.5?

According to [Anthropic's pricing page](https://claude.com/pricing#api), Claude Sonnet 4.5 is:

> **"Most intelligent for agents/coding"**

This makes it **perfect** for our agentic neurodata conversion system, which uses:
- ✅ Multi-agent architecture (Conversation, Conversion, Evaluation agents)
- ✅ Structured JSON outputs (8+ schemas for format detection, quality scoring, etc.)
- ✅ Domain-specific reasoning (neuroscience formats, NWB standards, DANDI requirements)
- ✅ Code analysis and optimization (parameter tuning, correction suggestions)

---

## Performance Improvements Expected

### 1. **Better Multi-Agent Coordination**
- More intelligent routing between agents
- Better context understanding across agent handoffs
- Improved decision-making in complex workflows

### 2. **Superior Structured Outputs**
- More reliable JSON generation (critical for our 8+ schemas)
- Better adherence to complex output formats
- Fewer parsing errors

### 3. **Enhanced Domain Reasoning**
- Deeper understanding of neuroscience data formats
- More accurate format detection for edge cases
- Better quality assessment and scoring
- More actionable correction suggestions

### 4. **Improved Agentic Capabilities**
- Proactive issue detection with higher accuracy
- Smarter parameter optimization
- More context-aware progress narration

## Pricing Comparison

| Model | Input ($/MTok) | Output ($/MTok) | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Sonnet 4.5** ⭐ | $3-6 | $15-22.50 | **Agents & coding** (our use case) |
| Sonnet 3.5 (old) | ~$3 | ~$15 | General tasks |
| Haiku 3.5 | $0.80 | $4 | Simple tasks only |
| Opus 4.1 | $15 | $75 | Complex reasoning (overkill) |

**Cost Impact**: Similar pricing to Sonnet 3.5, but with significantly better quality for agentic systems.

---

## Estimated Cost Per Conversion

Based on typical token usage:

**Per file conversion:** ~20K input tokens, ~3K output tokens

**Cost with Sonnet 4.5:**
- Input: $3 × 0.02 = $0.06
- Output: $15 × 0.003 = $0.045
- **Total: ~$0.105 per conversion** (~10 cents)

**At scale:**
- 100 conversions/day = $10.50/day = ~$315/month
- 1,000 conversions/day = $105/day = ~$3,150/month

## What Changed

### Code Changes:

**File**: `backend/src/services/llm_service.py`

```python
# Before (line 85):
def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"):

# After (line 85):
def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"):
```

**Updated docstring** to highlight Sonnet 4.5's agentic capabilities.

### No Configuration Changes Required:

The model upgrade is **automatic** - no environment variable changes needed. The system will use Sonnet 4.5 on next restart.

# Restart the server to use new model
pixi run serve
```

### Production:
No additional steps required. The model change is automatic once code is deployed.

### Verification:
Check logs for model identifier:
```
INFO: Using LLM model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Functional Tests:
1. **Format Detection**: Test with ambiguous/novel formats
2. **Quality Scoring**: Verify scores are more nuanced and accurate
3. **Proactive Detection**: Check predictions match actual outcomes
4. **Structured Outputs**: Ensure JSON parsing reliability is improved

### Performance Tests:
1. **Response Time**: Should be similar to Sonnet 3.5
2. **Token Usage**: Monitor for any changes in consumption
3. **Success Rate**: Track conversion success rates before/after

### Comparison Tests:
Run same files through old vs. new model and compare:
- Format detection confidence scores
- Quality assessment details
- Parameter optimization suggestions

---

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

```python
# In backend/src/services/llm_service.py, line 85:
def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"):
```

Then restart the server. No data loss or compatibility issues.
